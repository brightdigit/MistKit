			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor and Complete FieldValue System",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the refactoring of CKValue to FieldValue with: 1) Rename CKValue to FieldValue throughout codebase, 2) Add typed list support for all primitive types (stringList, int64List, etc.), 3) Implement convenience accessors for all field types, 4) Update Asset struct with file upload initializer, 5) Add Sendable conformance to all types. Focus on maintaining backward compatibility during the refactoring.",
			"reasoning": "The CKValue enum already exists with basic functionality. The main work involves renaming, adding list type variants, convenience accessors, and Sendable conformance. The existing structure in RecordInfo.swift provides a solid foundation requiring moderate refactoring rather than complete rewrite."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CloudKitRecord Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create CloudKitRecord implementation with: 1) Define CloudKitRecord struct with required properties and Codable conformance, 2) Implement bidirectional conversion between CloudKitRecord and OpenAPI Record types, 3) Add initializers with proper default values, 4) Create property wrapper @CloudKitField for type-safe field access. Build upon existing RecordInfo structure.",
			"reasoning": "RecordInfo already exists with similar functionality. The task mainly involves creating a new CloudKitRecord struct and migrating existing logic. The conversion logic is partially implemented in RecordInfo, reducing complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build High-Level Service Protocol",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Design CloudKitServiceProtocol with: 1) Define protocol with async CRUD methods for all databases, 2) Implement QueryResult type with pagination support, 3) Create AsyncSequence implementation for paginated results, 4) Add database-aware operation methods, 5) Implement atomic batch operations support, 6) Add desiredKeys parameter support for optimized fetching.",
			"reasoning": "CloudKitService exists but lacks protocol abstraction. Needs protocol definition, AsyncSequence implementation for pagination, and extending existing service to support all databases. The repetitive error handling code suggests need for abstraction."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Query Builder System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build comprehensive query builder with: 1) Create RecordQuery struct with basic where/and/or methods, 2) Implement all CloudKit operators (equals, greaterThan, contains, etc.), 3) Add sorting and pagination support (limit, offset), 4) Implement location-based query support with distance calculations, 5) Create @resultBuilder for declarative query syntax, 6) Add TRUEPREDICATE and full-text search support, 7) Implement type-safe field validation at compile time.",
			"reasoning": "No query builder exists currently. CloudKitService.queryRecords shows basic hardcoded queries. Building a type-safe, fluent API with result builders and compile-time validation requires significant new code."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Authentication Layer",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build comprehensive authentication with: 1) Define TokenManager protocol and base types, 2) Implement API token manager, 3) Implement web auth token manager with CharacterMapEncoder, 4) Build server-to-server auth with ECDSA P-256 signing, 5) Enhance AuthenticationMiddleware for all methods, 6) Add token refresh mechanisms, 7) Implement key rotation support, 8) Create retry logic with exponential backoff.",
			"reasoning": "Basic AuthenticationMiddleware exists for API/web tokens only. Server-to-server auth with ECDSA signing, key rotation, token refresh, and proper abstraction requires substantial new implementation. CryptoKit integration adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core CloudKit Operations",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Extend CloudKitService with: 1) Implement CloudKitServiceProtocol conformance, 2) Add create/update/delete record operations, 3) Implement batch operations with atomic flag support, 4) Add proper error mapping from CloudKit to typed Swift errors, 5) Implement retry logic with exponential backoff, 6) Add support for all databases (public/private/shared), 7) Add telemetry hooks for monitoring.",
			"reasoning": "CloudKitService has basic query/list operations. Needs CRUD operations, batch support, atomic operations, retry logic, and extending to all databases. The repetitive error handling code needs refactoring."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build mistk CLI Tool",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create CLI tool with: 1) Set up Swift ArgumentParser project structure, 2) Implement record management commands (CRUD), 3) Add zone and subscription commands, 4) Create asset upload/download commands, 5) Implement authentication configuration management, 6) Add stress testing and benchmark commands, 7) Implement JSON/YAML output formatters, 8) Add progress indicators and colorized output, 9) Create configuration file support (.mistk.yml).",
			"reasoning": "No CLI exists. Requires new executable target, ArgumentParser integration, multiple subcommands, configuration management, output formatting, progress indicators, and stress testing capabilities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Features",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Add advanced CloudKit features: 1) Implement zone creation/deletion for private database, 2) Add compile-time database validation for zones, 3) Create subscription management for push notifications, 4) Implement asset upload with multipart form data, 5) Add asset download with progress tracking, 6) Implement record changes API with change tokens, 7) Add incremental sync support, 8) Implement pagination with continuation tokens, 9) Add record shares support for shared database, 10) Create AsyncStream for real-time updates.",
			"reasoning": "These are entirely new features not present in current codebase. Requires understanding of CloudKit's advanced APIs, multipart uploads, change tokens, subscriptions, and real-time streaming."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Testing Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build comprehensive testing: 1) Expand XCTest suites for all components, 2) Create mock CloudKit server using Swift NIO, 3) Implement OpenAPI contract testing framework, 4) Add performance benchmarks with XCTest measure APIs, 5) Integrate SwiftCheck for property-based testing, 6) Create test fixtures for all CloudKit response types, 7) Set up continuous validation pipeline, 8) Implement mutation testing framework, 9) Create integration test suite against sandbox, 10) Achieve >90% code coverage.",
			"reasoning": "Minimal tests exist (MistKitTests.swift has basic unit tests). Needs mock server, contract testing, property-based testing, performance benchmarks, mutation testing, and continuous validation infrastructure."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Create Documentation and Examples",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create comprehensive documentation: 1) Set up DocC with API documentation for all public types, 2) Write migration guide from CloudKit framework to MistKit, 3) Build server-side demo with Vapor/Hummingbird including WebSocket support, 4) Enhance MistDemo with full CRUD operations, 5) Create Swift Playgrounds for interactive learning, 6) Write performance optimization and troubleshooting guides.",
			"reasoning": "Basic MistDemo exists but minimal. Needs DocC setup, migration guides, full-featured demos, playgrounds, and comprehensive documentation. Relatively straightforward documentation tasks once core features are complete."

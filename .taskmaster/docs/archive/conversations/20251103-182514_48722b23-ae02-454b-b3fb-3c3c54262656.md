    "text": "You are an AI assistant helping to update a subtask. You will be provided with the subtask's existing details, context about its parent and sibling tasks, and a user request string.\n\nYour Goal: Based *only* on the user's request and all the provided context (including existing details if relevant to the request), GENERATE the new text content that should be added to the subtask's details.\nFocus *only* on generating the substance of the update.\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Return *only* the newly generated text content as a plain string. Do NOT return a JSON object or any other structured data.\n2. Your string response should NOT include any of the subtask's original details, unless the user's request explicitly asks to rephrase, summarize, or directly modify existing text.\n3. Do NOT include any timestamps, XML-like tags, markdown, or any other special formatting in your string response.\n4. Ensure the generated text is concise yet complete for the update based on the user request. Avoid conversational fillers or explanations about what you are doing (e.g., do not start with \"Okay, here's the update...\"). \n\n Always respond in English.\n\nHuman: ## IMPORTANT: Codebase Analysis Required\n\nYou have access to powerful codebase analysis tools. Before generating the subtask update:\n\n1. Use the Glob tool to explore the project structure (e.g., \"**/*.js\", \"**/*.json\", \"**/README.md\")\n2. Use the Grep tool to search for existing implementations, patterns, and technologies\n3. Use the Read tool to examine relevant files and understand current implementation\n4. Analyze the current codebase to inform your subtask update\n\nBased on your analysis:\n- Include specific file references, code patterns, or implementation details\n- Ensure suggestions align with the project's current architecture\n- Reference existing components or patterns when relevant\n- Make implementation notes specific to the codebase structure\n\nProject Root: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit\n\nTask Context:\n\nParent Task: {\n  \"id\": 5,\n  \"title\": \"Bushel Version History Tool - Design and Core Implementation\"\n}\nPrevious Subtask: {\n  \"id\": \"5.1\",\n  \"title\": \"Design CloudKit Record Schema for Version Data\",\n  \"status\": \"done\"\n}\nNext Subtask: {\n  \"id\": \"5.3\",\n  \"title\": \"Implement Core CRUD Operations and Query Functionality\",\n  \"status\": \"in-progress\"\n}\nCurrent Subtask Details (for context only):\nInitialize a new Swift package with proper directory structure. Configure Package.swift with MistKit dependency using appropriate version constraints. Set up module organization with clear separation of concerns. Create initial source files and directory structure. Implement configuration management for CloudKit container and database settings. Set up development environment with proper CloudKit entitlements.\n\nUser Request: \"Successfully set up Swift Package structure for Bushel with:\n- Updated Package.swift to include Bushel executable target with MistKit and ArgumentParser dependencies\n- Created Version model with Codable, Comparable, Equatable, and CustomStringConvertible conformance\n- Implemented VersionParser for semantic version string parsing\n- Created BushelConfiguration for CloudKit settings with environment variable and JSON file loading\n- Set up command structure with Add, List, Show, Update, Delete stub commands\n- Created example configuration file (bushel-config.example.json)\n- Created comprehensive BUSHEL_README.md with usage instructions\n- Verified package builds successfully with no errors\n- Tested CLI help output - all commands properly configured\"\n\nBased on the User Request and all the Task Context (including current subtask details provided above), what is the new information or text that should be appended to this subtask's details? Return ONLY this new text as a plain string.\n\n\n# Additional Project Context\n\n## Task Context\n\n**Subtask 5.2: Set up Swift Package with MistKit Integration**\nParent Task: Bushel Version History Tool - Design and Core Implementation\nDescription: Create the Swift package structure and integrate MistKit as a dependency\nStatus: done\nDependencies: 1\nImplementation Details: Initialize a new Swift package with proper directory structure. Configure Package.swift with MistKit dependency using appropriate version constraints. Set up module organization with clear separation of concerns. Create initial source files and directory structure. Implement configuration management for CloudKit container and database settings. Set up development environment with proper CloudKit entitlements.\n\n---\n\n**Task 5: Bushel Version History Tool - Design and Core Implementation**\nDescription: Create a complete command-line tool demonstrating MistKit usage for managing version history data\nStatus: in-progress\nPriority: medium\nDependencies: 4\nImplementation Details: Design CloudKit record schema for version data storage including fields for version numbers, release dates, and metadata. Implement Swift Package with Package.swift using MistKit as dependency. Create core functionality for: version data collection, CloudKit record creation/updates, query operations for version history, and record modification workflows. Use Swift ArgumentParser for command-line interface. Implement proper error handling with Swift's Result type and structured concurrency wit...\nTest Strategy: Test with real CloudKit development environment. Verify CRUD operations work correctly. Test query functionality and data integrity. Validate command-line interface handles various input scenarios.\nSubtasks: 4 subtasks defined\n\n---\n\n**Task 6: Celestra RSS Feed Tool - Design and SyndiKit Integration**\nDescription: Create a command-line tool that fetches RSS feeds and stores them in CloudKit using MistKit\nStatus: pending\nPriority: medium\nDependencies: 4\nImplementation Details: Design CloudKit schema for RSS feed items including: feed metadata, item content, publication dates, and relationship handling. Create Swift Package structure with dependencies on both MistKit and SyndiKit (latest version 0.4+). Implement RSS feed fetching using SyndiKit's async APIs and URLSession. Parse feed data into structured models compatible with CloudKit record format. Implement duplicate detection logic using content hashing or unique identifiers. Use Swift's structured concurrency f...\nTest Strategy: Test with various RSS feed formats and sizes. Verify SyndiKit integration works correctly. Test duplicate detection prevents data redundancy. Validate batch operations perform efficiently.\nSubtasks: 3 subtasks defined\n\n---\n\n**Task 10: Blog Post Integration, Examples, and Final Polish**\nDescription: Complete the blog post with working examples, lessons learned, and comprehensive review\nStatus: pending\nPriority: high\nDependencies: 8, 9\nImplementation Details: Integrate command-line tool examples with complete source code and usage instructions. Write sections on: development journey insights, lessons learned and challenges, AWS Lambda conversion overview, architecture decisions, and future roadmap. Add comprehensive code comparisons showing generated vs. abstraction layer transformations. Include table of contents, proper cross-references, and links to GitHub repositories. Perform technical accuracy review ensuring all code compiles with latest Sw...\nTest Strategy: Compile and test all included code examples in fresh environments. Verify all links and references work correctly. Test blog post readability and technical accuracy through peer review. Validate formatting renders correctly on target platform.\nSubtasks: 3 subtasks defined\n\n---\n\n**Task 1: Historical Analysis and Development Journey Documentation**\nDescription: Analyze conversation history and extract the complete development story of MistKit's rewrite journey\nStatus: done\nPriority: high\nImplementation Details: Review all files in `.claude/conversations/` directory to extract key decisions, milestones, challenges, and solutions. Map the evolution from old MistKit to OpenAPI-driven approach. Document the 'why' behind major architectural decisions. Create a timeline of development phases and extract quotes/insights for the blog narrative. Use tools like `grep`, `awk`, and manual analysis to identify patterns in decision-making. Structure findings into narrative arcs for blog sections. Focus on extract...\nTest Strategy: Verify completeness by cross-referencing extracted decisions with actual code changes in git history.

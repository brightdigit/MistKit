I can help you find files, search code contents, and navigate the project structure.\n\nBased on the project context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with:\n- Main source code in `Sources/MistKit/`\n- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`\n- OpenAPI specification in `openapi.yaml`\n- Generated code directory `Sources/MistKit/Generated/`\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

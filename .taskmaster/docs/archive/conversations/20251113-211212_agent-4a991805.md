Some examples of what I can help with:\n\n- Finding specific files or patterns (e.g., \"Find all Swift test files\")\n- Searching for code patterns or implementations (e.g., \"Find where CloudKit authentication is handled\")\n- Locating configuration files or documentation\n- Finding files related to specific features or components\n\nWhat are you looking for?"

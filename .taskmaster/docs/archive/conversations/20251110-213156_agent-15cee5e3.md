I can help you find files, search code contents, and explore the project structure.\n\nBased on the environment information, I can see:\n- Working directory: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`\n- Current branch: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`\n- The repository is clean with recent commits related to Celestra implementation\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

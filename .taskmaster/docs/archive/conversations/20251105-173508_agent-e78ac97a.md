    "text": "I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit-Bushel codebase! I can help you find files, search code contents, and analyze the project structure.\n\nBased on the context, I can see this is a Swift package project for CloudKit Web Services access, with:\n- Main source code in `Sources/MistKit/`\n- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`\n- OpenAPI specification for CloudKit Web Services\n- A Bushel demo component\n- Task Master AI integration for project management\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

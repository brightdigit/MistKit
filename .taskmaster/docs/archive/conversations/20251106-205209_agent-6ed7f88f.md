    "text": "I'm ready to help you search and explore the MistKit-Bushel codebase. I can help you find files, search through code, read specific files, and navigate the project structure.\n\nBased on the context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with:\n- Main source code in `Sources/MistKit/`\n- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`\n- OpenAPI specification at `openapi.yaml`\n- Generated code (not committed) would be in `Sources/MistKit/Generated/`\n\nWhat would you like me to help you find or search for?"

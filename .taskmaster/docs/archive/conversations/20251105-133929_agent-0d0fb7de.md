I can see this is a Swift project with CloudKit integration, and there's a Bushel demo application that appears to be working with IPSW images and CloudKit records.\n\nI notice from the git status that you have:\n- Modified files in the Bushel example project\n- An untracked `BushelIPSW/` directory\n- An untracked `TheAppleWiki/` data source directory\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

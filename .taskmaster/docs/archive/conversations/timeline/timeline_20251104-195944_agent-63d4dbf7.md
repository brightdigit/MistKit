I'm ready to help you search and explore the MistKit-Bushel codebase. I can help you find files, search through code, read specific files, and navigate the project structure.

Based on the environment information, I can see you're working on a project related to MistKit (a CloudKit Web Services Swift package) and there's a Bushel demo component. The current branch is `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` and the repository is clean.

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase?

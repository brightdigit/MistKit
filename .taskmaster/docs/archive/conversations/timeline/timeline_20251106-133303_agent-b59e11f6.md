I'm ready to help you search and explore the MistKit-Bushel codebase! I can help you find files, search code content, and navigate the project structure.

Based on the context, I can see this is a Swift package project that provides CloudKit Web Services access. The project uses:
- Swift Package Manager
- OpenAPI code generation
- Modern Swift concurrency (async/await)
- Task Master AI for project management

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase?

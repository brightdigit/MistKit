### 20:11:40 - USER
I need to understand the current state of deprecated methods and demo implementations in the MistKit codebase.

Please:
1. Search for all `@available` attributes with deprecation markers (deprecated, obsoleted, etc.) across the codebase
2. Identify which files contain deprecated methods and what they are
3. Find all demo/example projects and applications in the repository
4. Check which deprecated APIs the demos are currently using
5. Identify the replacement/current versions for each deprecated method

Please provide:
- A comprehensive list of all deprecated methods with their locations
- What each deprecated method does and its replacement
- Which demos exist and what deprecated methods they're using
- File paths and line numbers for everything

Use thoroughness level: "very thorough" since we need to catch all deprecated methods and ensure all demos are checked.

### 20:11:43 - ASSISTANT
I'll conduct a thorough search of the MistKit codebase to find all deprecated methods and demo implementations.

### 20:11:43 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "@available.*deprecated" in MistKit]
[Grep: "@available.*obsoleted" in MistKit]
[Glob: **/Examples/**]
[Glob: **/Demo*/**]
[Bash: Find all example and demo directories]

### 20:11:52 - ASSISTANT
Now let me read the specific files with deprecated methods to understand them better:

### 20:11:52 - ASSISTANT
[Read: RecordBuilder.swift]
[Read: Types.swift]
[Read: Types.swift]
[Read: Types.swift]
[Read: TheAppleWikiFetcher.swift]
[Read: Client.swift]

### 20:12:01 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check if the demos are actually using these deprecated methods:

### 20:12:01 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "RecordBuilder\." in Examples]
[Grep: "buildRestoreImageOperation|bui" in Examples]
[Grep: "TheAppleWikiFetcher" in Examples]
[Grep: "lookupContacts" in MistKit]

### 20:12:09 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check the actual usage in the demos more thoroughly:

### 20:12:09 - ASSISTANT
[Read: DataSourcePipeline.swift]
[Grep: "toCloudKitFields" in Examples]
[Read: RestoreImageRecord.swift]
[Read: XcodeVersionRecord.swift]
[Read: SwiftVersionRecord.swift]
[Read: DataSourceMetadata.swift]

### 20:12:18 - ASSISTANT
Let me check if Celestra example is using any deprecated methods:

### 20:12:18 - ASSISTANT
[Glob: **/*.swift]
[Read: Article.swift]
[Read: Feed.swift]
[Bash: List examples directory]

### 20:12:25 - ASSISTANT
Let me check what documentation or README files reference these deprecated methods:

### 20:12:25 - ASSISTANT
[Read: README.md]
[Read: README.md]
[Grep: "CloudKitRecord" in Examples]

### 20:12:32 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check the CloudKitRecord protocol to understand the replacement pattern:

### 20:12:32 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "protocol CloudKitRecord" in Sources]
[Grep: "CloudKitRecordCollection" in Sources]
[Read: GeneratedCodeWorkflow.md]
[Read: CloudKitRecord.swift]
[Read: CloudKitRecordCollection.swift]

### 20:13:33 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me compile this information into a detailed report.

## Comprehensive Report: Deprecated Methods and Demo Usage in MistKit

Based on my thorough search of the MistKit codebase, here's a complete analysis of deprecated methods and their usage in demo applications:

---

## 1. DEPRECATED METHODS IN MISTKIT

### A. Example Code: RecordBuilder Enum (Bushel Demo)
**Location:** `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/Examples/Bushel/Sources/BushelImages/CloudKit/RecordBuilder.swift`

**Status:** Entire enum is deprecated

**Deprecated Methods:**
1. **`buildRestoreImageOperation(_:)`** (Line 12)
   - What it does: Converts `RestoreImageRecord` to `RecordOperation`
   - Replacement: Use `RestoreImageRecord.toCloudKitFields()` via `CloudKitRecord` protocol

2. **`buildXcodeVersionOperation(_:)`** (Line 46)
   - What it does: Converts `XcodeVersionRecord` to `RecordOperation`
   - Replacement: Use `XcodeVersionRecord.toCloudKitFields()` via `CloudKitRecord` protocol

3. **`buildSwiftVersionOperation(_:)`** (Line 96)
   - What it does: Converts `SwiftVersionRecord` to `RecordOperation`
   - Replacement: Use `SwiftVersionRecord.toCloudKitFields()` via `CloudKitRecord` protocol

4. **`buildDataSourceMetadataOperation(_:)`** (Line 123)
   - What it does: Converts `DataSourceMetadata` to `RecordOperation`
   - Replacement: Use `DataSourceMetadata.toCloudKitFields()` via `CloudKitRecord` protocol

**Deprecation Message:**
```swift
@available(*, deprecated, message: "Use CloudKitRecord protocol and model.toCloudKitFields() instead")
```

### B. Example Code: TheAppleWikiFetcher (Bushel Demo)
**Location:** `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/Examples/Bushel/Sources/BushelImages/DataSources/TheAppleWiki/TheAppleWikiFetcher.swift`

**Status:** Entire struct is deprecated (Line 4)

**Deprecation Message:**
```swift
@available(*, deprecated, message: "Use AppleDBFetcher instead for more reliable and up-to-date data")
```

**What it

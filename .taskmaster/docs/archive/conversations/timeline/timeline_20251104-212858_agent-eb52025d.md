I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit-Celestra codebase. I have access to the project context including:

- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Main Branch**: main
- **Repository Status**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)

I can efficiently search through your codebase using:
- **Glob patterns** for broad file matching
- **Grep with regex** for searching file contents
- **Read operations** for viewing specific files
- **Bash commands** for file exploration

Key information about your setup:
- Working directory: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit-Celestra`
- Git repository with recent commits on CloudKit schema management and Examples reorganization
- Project includes OpenAPI specifications, Swift Package structure, and comprehensive documentation

I'm ready to help you search for files, understand the codebase structure, or locate specific code patterns. What would you like to explore?

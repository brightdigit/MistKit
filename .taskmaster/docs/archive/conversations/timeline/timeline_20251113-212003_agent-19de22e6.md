I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit codebase.

I understand the project context:
- **MistKit**: A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Working Directory**: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit
- **Git Status**: Clean

I have access to comprehensive project documentation including:
- Modern Swift development practices (async/await, actors, concurrency)
- OpenAPI-driven development with swift-openapi-generator
- CloudKit Web Services REST API integration
- Swift Testing framework usage
- Task Master AI integration for project management

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns and regex
- Read and analyze code contents
- Navigate the codebase structure
- Explore documentation and examples
- Help with implementation guidance based on the project's architecture

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the MistKit codebase?

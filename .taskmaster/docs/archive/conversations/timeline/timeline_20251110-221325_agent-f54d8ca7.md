Warmup

### 22:13:32 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with the MistKit project. I can see you're working on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch, which appears to be focused on the Celestra example in the Examples directory.

I understand this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with:
- Modern Swift features (async/await, actors, structured concurrency)
- OpenAPI-driven development using `openapi.yaml`
- Swift Testing framework for tests
- Focus on server-side and CLI access to CloudKit

The recent commits show work on:
- Comprehensive error handling and batch operations for Celestra
- Duplicate detection and schema improvements
- Import schema script
- Removing `Public*` prefix

I'm ready to help with:
- Searching and navigating the codebase
- Finding specific files or code patterns
- Reading and analyzing implementation details
- Locating examples, tests, or documentation

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase?

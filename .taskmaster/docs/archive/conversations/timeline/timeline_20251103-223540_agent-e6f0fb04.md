### 22:35:40 - USER
I need to understand the Bushel project requirements and current task structure to design CloudKit schemas. Please:

1. Read the main project documentation files to understand what Bushel is and what it needs from CloudKit
2. Look for any existing schema definitions, data models, or API structures
3. Review the task list (use get_tasks MCP tool with projectRoot="/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit") to understand what features need CloudKit support
4. Search for any references to "restore images", "OS metadata", "Bushel", or data models in the codebase
5. Look for documentation about what data sources will feed into CloudKit
6. Check if there are any existing CloudKit record type definitions or data structure specifications

Provide a comprehensive summary of:
- What Bushel does and its data requirements
- What the demo app needs to demonstrate
- Current task context related to CloudKit schemas
- Any existing data models or structures to build upon
- What data sources will populate CloudKit (scraping, APIs, etc.)

Be thorough - explore docs/, tasks/, and source files. Set thoroughness to "very thorough".

### 22:35:43 - ASSISTANT
I'll conduct a comprehensive exploration of the Bushel project to understand its requirements and current task structure for CloudKit schema design.

[Glob: **/*bushel*]
[Glob: **/*Bushel*]
[Glob: **/docs/**/*.{md,txt}]
[Glob: **/*.md]

### 22:35:50 - ASSISTANT
Now let me read the key documentation files to understand Bushel's purpose and requirements:

### 22:35:50 - ASSISTANT
[Read: README.md]
[Read: README.md]
[Grep: "Bushel|bushel|version history|" in ]

### 22:35:56 - ASSISTANT
Now let me search for more specific information about Bushel and examine the blog post documents:

### 22:35:56 - ASSISTANT
[Read: prd.txt]
[Read: blog-post-outline-claude.md]
[Grep: "macOS|Swift|Xcode|version|rest" in docs]

### 22:36:05 - ASSISTANT
Let me search for more information about what "Bushel" actually is as a product/project:

### 22:36:05 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "Bushel|bushel" in MistKit]
[Glob: **/Examples/**/*.swift]
[Bash: List Leo's project directories]
[Read: blog-post-outline-claude.md]

### 22:36:13 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now let me check if there's any existing Bushel project information:

### 22:36:13 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: List Bushel project directory contents]
[Bash: Find documentation in Bushel project]
[Read: blog-post-writing-template.md]
[Read: README.md]
[Read: CLAUDE.md]

### 22:36:25 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information. Let me search for any existing information about what data Bushel might want to store in CloudKit:

### 22:36:25 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "CloudKit|cloudkit|restore.*ima" in Bushel]
[Bash: Find IPSW, Library, or Version related f]

### 22:36:32 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check the IPSWDownloads package to understand the data structures:

### 22:36:32 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Find source files in IPSWDownloads]
[Read: README.md]

### 22:37:22 - ASSISTANT
Excellent! Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me compile this research into a clear summary for you.

# Comprehensive Summary: Bushel Project Requirements and CloudKit Schema Design

## What Bushel Is

**Bushel** is a macOS virtualization application (App Store product by BrightDigit LLC) that uses Apple's Virtualization framework to run macOS virtual machines on Apple Silicon. It's a sophisticated native Mac app with the following characteristics:

- **Purpose**: Create and manage macOS VMs on Apple Silicon Macs
- **Technology**: Apple's Virtualization framework, SwiftUI, Swift 6 with strict concurrency
- **Architecture**: Main app + XPC service for VM isolation
- **Distribution**: Mac App Store (proprietary)
- **Requirements**: Apple Silicon Mac, macOS 14+, significant disk space (100GB+ per VM, 16GB+ per restore image)

## What Data Bushel Works With

Based on the project structure and dependencies, Bushel manages:

1. **Restore Images (.ipsw files)**
   - macOS firmware files downloaded from Apple
   - Used to install macOS VMs
   - Managed via the **IPSWDownloads** package (Swift API for ipsw.me)
   - Stored in "Library" (BushelLibrary* modules)

2. **Virtual Machines**
   - VM configurations and state
   - Machine metadata and settings
   - Managed via BushelMachine* modules

3. **Operating System Versions**
   - macOS version information
   - Release dates and metadata
   - Retrieved from ipsw.me API

## Blog Post Demo App Requirements

For the MistKit blog post (currently Task 5 - **pending**), you need to create a **"Bushel Version History Tool"** - a command-line demo that:

### Purpose
Demonstrate practical MistKit usage by tracking macOS, Swift, Xcode, iOS, and other OS version history in CloudKit.

### Use Case from Blog Outline
> "Bushel's need: Track macOS, Swift, Xcode versions over time"
> "Why CloudKit: Centralized data, accessible from multiple tools"
> "Requirements: Store version data, query history, update existing records"

### 15:34:15 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with searching and exploring the MistKit codebase. I have access to the project context and understand the architecture:

- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Key Files**: OpenAPI specification, Swift source code, tests, and documentation
- **Working Directory**: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit

I can help you:

1. **Find files** using glob patterns and file matching
2. **Search code** with regex and grep for specific patterns
3. **Read and analyze** file contents
4. **Navigate the codebase** efficiently

I'm prepared to handle:
- Swift source code analysis
- CloudKit API exploration
- Schema and configuration file searches
- Test file location and review
- Documentation discovery

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit codebase?

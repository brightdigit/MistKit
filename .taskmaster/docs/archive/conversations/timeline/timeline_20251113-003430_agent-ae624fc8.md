I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search code contents, and explore the project structure.

What would you like me to search for? For example, I can:
- Find files matching specific patterns (e.g., "Find all Swift test files")
- Search for code containing specific text or patterns (e.g., "Find usages of async/await")
- Locate specific files or directories
- Explore the project structure

What's your search request?

I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit-Bushel codebase. I have access to:

- **Project context**: MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current branch**: blog-post-examples-code-bushel
- **Key files**: CLAUDE.md with detailed development instructions, openapi.yaml for CloudKit Web Services spec
- **Task Master integration**: Available for task management and tracking

I can help you:
- Find files using glob patterns and regex search
- Read and analyze code contents
- Navigate the codebase structure
- Search for specific implementations or patterns
- Explore the BushelIPSW/ directory and other recent additions

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

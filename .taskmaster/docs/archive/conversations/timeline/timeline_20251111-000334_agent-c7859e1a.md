I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search for code patterns, or explore the project structure.

Based on the context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with a focus on the Celestra example (as indicated by your current branch `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`).

What would you like me to search for or explore?

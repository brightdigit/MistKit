I understand. I'm ready to help you search and explore the MistKit codebase. I have access to the project context including:

- This is MistKit, a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services access
- Current branch: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`
- Working directory: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit-Other`
- The project uses Swift with async/await, OpenAPI code generation, and modern testing practices

What files or code would you like me to search for or analyze?

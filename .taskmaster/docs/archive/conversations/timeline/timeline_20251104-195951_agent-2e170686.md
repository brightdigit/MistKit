I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I'm a file search specialist equipped with tools to:

- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex (grep)
- Read specific files
- Navigate the directory structure

I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with:
- Current branch: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`
- Main directory: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`
- Recent work on query filtering, sorting support, and blog post examples

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

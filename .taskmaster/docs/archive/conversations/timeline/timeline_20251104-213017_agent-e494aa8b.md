### 21:30:17 - USER
I need to:
1. Explore the current codebase structure to find the Celestra example and understand its data model
2. Check out the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch and examine the setup-cloudkit-schema.sh script at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/Examples/Bushel/Scripts/setup-cloudkit-schema.sh`
3. Compare the data models between Bushel and Celestra to understand what schema needs to be created

Current working directory: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit-Celestra

Please explore:
- The Examples directory structure in the current branch
- Look for Celestra-related files and data models
- Switch to the blog-post-examples-code-bushel branch and read the setup-cloudkit-schema.sh script
- Identify the Bushel data model/schema to understand the pattern

Set thoroughness to "medium" - I need to understand both examples' structures and the script pattern.

### 21:30:21 - ASSISTANT
I'll help you explore the codebase structure and compare the Celestra and Bushel examples. Let me start by examining the current branch's Examples directory, then switch to the Bushel branch to analyze the setup script.

### 21:30:21 - ASSISTANT
[Glob: **/Examples/**/*.swift]
[Glob: **/Examples/**/Package.swift]
[Glob: **/Examples/**/Scripts/**]
[Bash: List Examples directory structure]

### 21:30:26 - ASSISTANT
Now let me read the Celestra data models to understand its schema:

### 21:30:26 - ASSISTANT
[Read: PublicArticle.swift]
[Read: PublicFeed.swift]

### 21:30:31 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check if there's a Scripts directory in Celestra and then switch to the Bushel branch:

### 21:30:31 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check Celestra directory structure]
[Bash: Fetch the Bushel branch]

### 02:58:26 - ASSISTANT
Now let me read the setup-cloudkit-schema.sh script from the Bushel branch:

### 02:58:26 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Read Bushel setup script from remote bra]

### 02:59:12 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check for the Bushel schema file and models to understand the data structure:

### 02:59:12 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Read Bushel schema file]
[Bash: List Bushel example files]

### 02:59:26 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now let me read one of the Bushel model files to see how they map to the schema:

### 02:59:26 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Read Bushel RestoreImage model]

### 02:59:36 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check the README files for both examples to understand their purposes better:

### 02:59:36 - ASSISTANT
[Read: README.md]
[Bash: Read Bushel README]

### 02:59:40 - ASSISTANT
Excellent! Now let me check if there's documentation about the CloudKit schema setup process:

### 02:59:40 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Read CloudKit schema setup documentation]

### 03:00:13 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. Let me create a comprehensive summary of my findings:

## Summary of Findings

I've successfully explored both the **Celestra** (current branch) and **Bushel** (blog-post-examples-code-bushel branch) examples. Here's what I found:

---

## **Celestra Example** (Current Branch: blog-post-examples-code-celestra)

### Purpose
An RSS reader CLI that demonstrates MistKit's query filtering and sorting features by managing RSS feeds in CloudKit's public database.

### Data Model
Two record types in the **Public Database**:

#### **PublicFeed**
- `feedURL` (String, indexed)
- `title` (String)
- `totalAttempts` (Int64)
- `successfulAttempts` (Int64)
- `usageCount` (Int64)
- `lastAttempted` (Date/Time, indexed)

#### **PublicArticle**
- `feedRecordName` (String, indexed) - links to PublicFeed
- `title` (String)
- `link` (String)
- `description` (String)
- `author` (String)
- `pubDate` (Date/Time)
- `guid` (String, indexed)
- `fetchedAt` (Date/Time)
- `expiresAt` (Date/Time, indexed)

### Current State
- ❌ **No Scripts directory exists** in Celestra
- ❌ **No schema.ckdb file** exists
- ❌ **No setup-cloudkit-schema.sh script** exists
- ✅ Manual setup instructions exist in README.md

## **Bushel Example** (Branch: blog-post-examples-code-bushel)

### Purpose
A CLI tool that syncs macOS restore images, Xcode versions, and Swift compiler versions to CloudKit from multiple data sources.

### Data Model
Three record types in the **Public Database** with relationships:

#### **RestoreImage**
- `version` (String, queryable/sortable/searchable)
- `buildNumber` (String, queryable/sortable)
- `releaseDate` (Timestamp, queryable/sortable)
- `downloadURL` (String)
- `fileSize` (Int64)
- `sha256Hash` (String)
- `sha1Hash` (String)
- `isSigned` (Int64, queryable)
- `isPrerelease` (Int64, queryable)
- `source` (String)
- `notes` (String)

#### **XcodeVersion**
- `version` (String, queryable/sortable/searchable)
- `buildNumber` (String, quer

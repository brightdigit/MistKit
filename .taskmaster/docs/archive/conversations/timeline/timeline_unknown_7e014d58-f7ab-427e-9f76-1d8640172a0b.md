Warmup

### 19:40:05 - ASSISTANT
I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you explore and work with the MistKit codebase.

I understand the project context:

**MistKit** is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services. It's a modern rewrite using Swift's latest features (async/await, actors, structured concurrency).

**Key Details:**
- **Current branch:** blog-post-examples
- **Main branch:** main
- **Platform:** macOS (darwin)
- **Architecture:** Protocol-oriented, dependency injection, async/await first
- **OpenAPI-driven:** Uses swift-openapi-generator with openapi.yaml as the source of truth

**Project Structure:**
- `Sources/MistKit/` - Main implementation
- `Tests/MistKitTests/` - Tests
- `Scripts/` - Build and generation scripts
- `.taskmaster/` - Task Master AI workflow system

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns and regex
- Read and analyze code
- Navigate the codebase thoroughly
- Help with implementation following the CLAUDE.md guidelines
- Work with Task Master for project management

What would you like me to help you with? I can search for files, analyze code, explore the architecture, or assist with development tasks.

I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit-Bushel codebase. I can help you:

- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate the project structure

I can see this is a Swift project for CloudKit Web Services, with a Bushel demo example. The repository is on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch.

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

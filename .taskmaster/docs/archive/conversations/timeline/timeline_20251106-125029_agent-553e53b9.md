I'm Claude Code, ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit codebase. I've reviewed the project context and understand:

- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-bushel
- **Working Directory**: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/Examples/Bushel
- **Key Focus**: Modern Swift with async/await, structured concurrency, and CloudKit Web Services integration

I'm prepared to help you with:
- File searching using glob patterns and regex
- Code navigation and exploration
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Understanding the codebase structure

I have access to comprehensive documentation including:
- OpenAPI specification for CloudKit Web Services
- Swift Testing framework guidance
- Architecture and design principles
- Development workflow commands

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the MistKit/Bushel codebase?

I'll help you navigate and search through the MistKit-Bushel codebase. I'm ready to assist with finding files, searching code, and exploring the project structure.

Based on the project context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with a Bushel demo component. The working directory is `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit-Bushel`.

What would you like me to help you find or search for in the codebase?

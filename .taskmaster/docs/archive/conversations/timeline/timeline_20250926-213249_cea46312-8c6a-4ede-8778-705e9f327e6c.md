Look for code comments for missing implementations

### 21:32:56 - ASSISTANT
I'll search for code comments that indicate missing implementations in the MistKit codebase.

### 21:32:56 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK|BUG|NOTE.*" in ]

### 21:33:01 - ASSISTANT
Let me search more specifically for implementation-related comments:

### 21:33:01 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "//.*[Tt][Oo][Dd][Oo]|//.*[Ff][" in ]

### 21:33:08 - ASSISTANT
Let me also check for Swift-style comments and common patterns:

### 21:33:08 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "fatalError|preconditionFailure" in ]

### 21:33:11 - ASSISTANT
Let me also check for empty or stub implementations:

### 21:33:11 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "^\s*\}$|^\s*\{\s*\}$|func.*\{\" in ]

### 21:33:16 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check more specifically for incomplete implementations or method stubs:

### 21:33:16 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "throw.*Error\(|throw.*notImple" in ]

### 21:33:30 - ASSISTANT
Based on my comprehensive search through the MistKit codebase, I found very few actual missing implementations or TODO comments. Here's what I discovered:

## Code Comments Analysis Results

**Good News**: The MistKit codebase appears to be very well-implemented with minimal missing functionality.

### Findings:

1. **No Traditional TODO/FIXME Comments**: No `// TODO`, `// FIXME`, `// XXX`, or `// HACK` comments found in Swift source files.

2. **No Stub Implementations**: No empty function bodies or placeholder implementations found.

3. **Generated Code Patterns**: Most of the `fatalError` and `preconditionFailure` calls are in auto-generated OpenAPI client code (`Sources/MistKit/Generated/Client.swift`), which are proper error handling patterns, not missing implementations.

4. **Legitimate Error Handling**: The remaining error-throwing code consists of proper error handling and validation logic, not missing implementations.

5. **Test Infrastructure**: Most `fatalError` calls are in test setup code for creating mock URLs, which is appropriate test infrastructure.

### Potential Areas for Enhancement (Not Missing Implementations):

1. **MistKitConfiguration.swift:64,102** - Contains `fatalError` calls for invalid configurations, which are appropriate for configuration validation.

2. **AuthenticationMiddleware.swift:124,128** - Contains appropriate error throwing for unsupported platform scenarios.

3. **Generated Client Code** - Auto-generated code with appropriate precondition failures for content type validation.

## Conclusion

The MistKit codebase is remarkably complete and well-implemented. There are no obvious missing implementations or TODO items that need immediate attention. The codebase demonstrates good software engineering practices with proper error handling throughout.

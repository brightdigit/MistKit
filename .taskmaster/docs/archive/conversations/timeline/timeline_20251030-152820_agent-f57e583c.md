### 15:28:20 - USER
Explore the blog post files in .taskmaster/docs/ to understand:
1. What blog post content exists (both Claude and Leo versions)
2. The structure and completeness of outlines and drafts
3. Any obvious issues with formatting, content gaps, or organizational problems
4. How this relates to being a follow-up to the SyntaxKit article at https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/syntaxkit-swift-code-generation/

Focus on:
- .taskmaster/docs/blog-post-outline-claude.md
- .taskmaster/docs/blog-post-outline-leo.md
- .taskmaster/docs/blog-post-draft-claude.md
- .taskmaster/docs/blog-post-draft-leo.md

I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search code contents, and explore the repository structure.

What would you like me to search for? For example, I can help you:
- Find specific files by name or pattern
- Search for code containing certain functions, types, or patterns
- Locate configuration files
- Explore specific directories
- Find files related to certain features

What are you looking for?

I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase. I can help you find files, search code contents, and explore the project structure.

Some things I can help with:
- Finding files matching specific patterns (using glob)
- Searching for code or text within files (using grep)
- Reading specific files you need to examine
- Exploring the codebase structure

What would you like me to search for or help you find in the MistKit project?

### 15:17:58 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist with your search requests! I'm Claude Code, operating as a file search specialist for the MistKit project.

I have access to:
- **Project context**: MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current branch**: blog-post-examples-code-bushel
- **Environment**: macOS (Darwin 25.0.0)
- **Search tools**: Glob patterns, Grep with regex, file reading, and bash operations

I understand the project structure and can efficiently:
1. Find files using glob patterns
2. Search code with powerful regex
3. Read and analyze file contents
4. Navigate the codebase thoroughly

I'm prepared to handle searches at any thoroughness level and will return results with absolute file paths and relevant code snippets.

What would you like me to search for in the MistKit codebase?

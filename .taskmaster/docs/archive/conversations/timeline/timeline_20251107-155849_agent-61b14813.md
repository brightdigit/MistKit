I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you with file searching and code exploration in the MistKit repository.

I've reviewed the project context:

**MistKit** is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services. Key points:
- Modern Swift rewrite with async/await, structured concurrency, and protocols
- Uses OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification for CloudKit Web Services
- Located at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`
- Currently on branch `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`

I'm equipped to:
- **Search files** using glob patterns for broad matching
- **Search content** with regex patterns to find specific code
- **Read files** when I know exact paths
- **Navigate the codebase** efficiently

The repository has comprehensive development guidance in:
- `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions
- `.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md` - Task Master AI integration guidelines
- `openapi.yaml` - CloudKit Web Services API specification

I'm ready for your search requests. What would you like to explore in the MistKit codebase?

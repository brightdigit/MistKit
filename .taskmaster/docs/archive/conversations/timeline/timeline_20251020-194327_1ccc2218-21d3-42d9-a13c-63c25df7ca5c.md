### 19:43:32 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with your MistKit project! I have access to the repository at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit` and I understand the project context:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- Currently on the `blog-post-examples` branch
- Uses modern Swift features (async/await, structured concurrency, actors)
- OpenAPI-driven development with `openapi.yaml` as the source of truth

**Key Information I have:**
- Development commands for Swift package management
- Architecture principles (protocol-oriented, dependency injection, Sendable compliance)
- CloudKit Web Services integration details
- Task Master AI workflow integration available

**What I can do:**
- Search and explore the codebase using glob patterns and grep
- Read and analyze file contents
- Find specific files and code snippets
- Navigate the project structure efficiently

I'm warmed up and ready to help! What would you like me to search for or analyze in the MistKit project?

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, specializing in file search and codebase exploration.

I have the context loaded for the MistKit project:
- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Working Directory**: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit
- **Recent Activity**: Fresh rewrite with modern Swift features and best practices

I can help you with:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code with regex patterns
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Exploring the codebase structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit project?

Your response MUST start with { and end with }

### 19:51:33 - ASSISTANT
I need to analyze the existing codebase to understand the current state and provide an accurate update to the task.

### 19:51:33 - ASSISTANT
[Glob: Examples/Celestra/**/*.swift]
[Read: BUSHEL_PATTERNS.md]
[Read: PublicArticle.swift]
[Read: CloudKitService+Celestra.swift]
[Grep: "TODO|FIXME|duplicate|dedup" in Celestra]

### 19:53:15 - ASSISTANT
Based on my analysis of the existing Celestra codebase, I can see that:

1. Core infrastructure is indeed complete (~75%) with schema, RSS fetching, CloudKit operations, and CLI commands implemented
2. Models are defined with CloudKit integration
3. RSS fetching service exists 
4. CloudKit service extensions are implemented
5. The main missing piece is duplicate detection functionality mentioned in the BUSHEL_PATTERNS.md documentation

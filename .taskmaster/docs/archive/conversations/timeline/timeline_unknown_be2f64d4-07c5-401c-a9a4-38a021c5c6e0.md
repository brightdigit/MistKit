Perfect! I've successfully removed section 3.3 (Cross-Platform Crypto) from the blog post template. The changes made were:

1. **Removed Section 3.3** - The entire "Cross-Platform Crypto" section has been deleted
2. **Renumbered subsequent sections** - Section 3.4 (Generated Code Quality) is now Section 3.3, and Section 3.5 (Pre-Generation Strategy) is now Section 3.4

The template now flows directly from Section 3.2 (Authentication Method Conflicts) to Section 3.3 (Generated Code Quality) without the Cross-Platform Crypto section.

### 20:42:34 - USER
Remove section 3.4

### 20:42:38 - ASSISTANT
I'll remove section 3.4 (Pre-Generation Strategy) from the blog post template.

### 20:42:46 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! I've successfully removed section 3.4 (Pre-Generation Strategy) from the blog post template. The document now flows directly from Section 3.3 (Generated Code Quality) to PART 4 (Building the Abstraction Layer with Claude Code).

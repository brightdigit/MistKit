I'm ready to help you with your MistKit project! I've reviewed the context and understand the setup:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- Currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch
- Uses modern Swift features (async/await, actors, structured concurrency)
- Has OpenAPI specification as the foundation

**Key Tools & Commands Available:**
- Swift package management (build, test, etc.)
- OpenAPI code generation via `./Scripts/generate-openapi.sh`
- Task Master for project task management
- Testing with Swift Testing framework (`@Test` macro)

**Important Guidelines I'm Following:**
- Using absolute file paths in responses
- No emoji usage for clear communication
- Not modifying the user's system state
- Adhering to the explicit ACLs and Swift code standards defined in CLAUDE.md
- Consulting `.claude/docs/` reference materials when needed (webservices.md, cloudkitjs.md, testing-enablinganddisabling.md, swift-openapi-generator.md)

I'm ready to help with:
- Finding files and searching through the codebase
- Analyzing code and architecture
- Working with the OpenAPI specification
- Managing tasks and development workflow
- Understanding CloudKit Web Services integration

What would you like me to help you with?

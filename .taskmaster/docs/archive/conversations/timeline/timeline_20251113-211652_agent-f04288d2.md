Warmup

### 21:16:56 - ASSISTANT
I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to assist with file search, code exploration, and navigation of the MistKit codebase.

I understand the project context:
- **MistKit**: A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Key Tools**: Swift Package Manager, OpenAPI code generation, Swift Testing framework
- **Architecture**: Modern Swift with async/await, structured concurrency, and protocol-oriented design

I'm equipped to:
- Use glob patterns for broad file matching
- Search with regex patterns via grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate the codebase efficiently
- Respect the project guidelines from CLAUDE.md

I have access to extensive reference documentation in `.claude/docs/` including CloudKit Web Services, CloudKit JS Framework, Swift Testing, and OpenAPI Generator guidance.

Ready to help with your search requests. What would you like to explore in the MistKit codebase?

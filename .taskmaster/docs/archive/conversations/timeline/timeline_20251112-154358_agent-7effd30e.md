I'll help you search through the MistKit codebase. I'm ready to find files, search code content, or read specific files using glob patterns, regex searches, and direct file reads.

What would you like me to search for? You can ask me to:
- Find files matching certain patterns (e.g., "find all Swift test files")
- Search for specific code or text (e.g., "search for RSS-related code")
- Read specific files if you know their paths
- Explore certain directories or components

What's your search request?

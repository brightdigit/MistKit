I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit-Bushel codebase! I can help you find files, search code contents, and analyze the project structure.

Based on the context, I can see this is a Swift package project for CloudKit Web Services access, with:
- Main source code in `Sources/MistKit/`
- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`
- OpenAPI specification for CloudKit Web Services
- A Bushel demo component
- Task Master AI integration for project management

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

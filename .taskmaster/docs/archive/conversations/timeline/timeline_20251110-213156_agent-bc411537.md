I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit codebase. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist, and I can help you:

- **Find files** using glob patterns
- **Search code** with powerful regex patterns
- **Read and analyze** file contents
- **Explore the codebase structure** efficiently

I have context about:
- **MistKit**: A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current branch**: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`
- **Main branch**: `main`
- **Project structure**: Located at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`

I'm familiar with the project's key aspects:
- Modern Swift with async/await and structured concurrency
- OpenAPI-driven development using swift-openapi-generator
- Swift Testing framework for tests
- Protocol-oriented, dependency-injection architecture
- CloudKit Web Services REST API integration

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase? I can help with:
- Finding specific files or patterns
- Understanding code structure
- Locating implementations
- Searching for functions, types, or configurations
- Any other code navigation tasks

Just let me know what you're looking for!

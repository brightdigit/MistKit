LEt's add a public static property for the URL(string: "https://api.apple-cloudkit.com")

### 21:45:06 - ASSISTANT
I'll add a public static property for the CloudKit API base URL. Let me first check the current structure of the MistKit package to find the appropriate place to add this.

### 21:45:06 - ASSISTANT
[Glob: Sources/**/*.swift]

### 21:45:09 - ASSISTANT
Let me check the main MistKitClient.swift file to see the current structure:

### 21:45:09 - ASSISTANT
[Read: MistKitClient.swift]

### 21:45:13 - ASSISTANT
Looking at the structure, I see that the MistKitClient is internal and references a `serverURL` from the configuration. Let me check the MistKitConfiguration to see if that's where the URL should be defined:

### 21:45:13 - ASSISTANT
[Read: MistKitConfiguration.swift]

### 21:45:18 - ASSISTANT
I can see that the CloudKit API URL is already hardcoded in the `serverURL` computed property on line 63. However, to make this more accessible and public, I should add a public static property. Let me create this in the main MistKit module. I'll add it to the MistKitConfiguration file since that's where the URL is currently defined:

### 21:45:18 - ASSISTANT
[Edit: MistKitConfiguration.swift]

### 21:45:33 - USER
[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

### 21:45:48 - USER
MistKitConfiguration is internal so it won't be accessible

### 21:45:51 - ASSISTANT
You're right! Since `MistKitConfiguration` is internal, a public static property there won't be accessible. Let me find a better place to add this public static property. Let me check what files are public or create a dedicated public file for constants.

### 21:45:51 - ASSISTANT
[Glob: Sources/MistKit/*.swift]

### 21:45:54 - ASSISTANT
Let me check the Environment.swift file since that's likely to be public:

### 21:45:54 - ASSISTANT
[Read: Environment.swift]

### 21:45:59 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! The `Environment` enum is public. I can add the CloudKit API URL constant there, or I could create a new public struct for MistKit constants. Let me add it to the Environment file since it's already public and related to CloudKit configuration:

### 21:45:59 - ASSISTANT
[Edit: Environment.swift]

### 21:46:06 - ASSISTANT
Now let me update the MistKitConfiguration to use this public constant instead of the hardcoded URL:

### 21:46:06 - ASSISTANT
[Edit: MistKitConfiguration.swift]

### 21:46:15 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! I've added a public static property `MistKit.cloudKitAPIURL` that contains the CloudKit Web Services API URL. This is now accessible to consumers of the MistKit package as `MistKit.cloudKitAPIURL`. I also updated the internal configuration to use this constant instead of hardcoding the URL.

Warmup

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit codebase.

I have access to:
- File search using glob patterns
- Content search using regex patterns
- File reading capabilities
- Bash operations for file management

I understand the MistKit project context:
- **Swift Package** for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Modern Swift features**: async/await, structured concurrency, actors, protocol-oriented design
- **Key files**: OpenAPI spec (`openapi.yaml`), generated client code in `Sources/MistKit/Generated/`
- **Testing**: Swift Testing framework with `@Test` macros
- **Logging**: Centralized `MistKitLogger` with subsystems for api, auth, and network

Current branch: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`

I'm ready to help you search through the codebase, find specific files, analyze code patterns, or explore the project structure. What would you like me to help you find?

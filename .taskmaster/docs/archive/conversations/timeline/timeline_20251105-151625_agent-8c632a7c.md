### 15:16:30 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with the MistKit project. I've reviewed the CLAUDE.md instructions and understand:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for server-side and CLI access to CloudKit Web Services (REST API)
- Currently on the `claude` branch with a modern rewrite using Swift concurrency
- Uses OpenAPI specification as the foundation for implementation

**Key Technical Details:**
- Async/await first approach for all network operations
- Protocol-oriented design with dependency injection
- Swift Testing framework for tests
- Auto-generated code from OpenAPI spec (not committed)
- Cross-platform support (Linux, server-side Swift, CLI tools)

**Current Context:**
- Working directory: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/Examples/Celestra`
- Current branch: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`
- Recent changes include CloudKit schema setup automation and directory reorganization

I'm ready to help you search through the codebase, analyze files, find specific patterns, or navigate the project structure. What would you like me to help you with?

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I'm ready to help you explore the MistKit codebase efficiently.

I understand the project context:
- **MistKit**: A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Working Directory**: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit-Other

I have access to powerful search tools:
- **Glob**: Pattern matching for finding files
- **Grep**: Regex-based content searching
- **Read**: Direct file content retrieval
- **Bash**: File operations

I'm also aware of the project's guidelines:
- Use async/await for all network operations
- Protocol-oriented design with dependency injection
- Swift Testing framework for tests
- Modern Swift features (actors, result builders, property wrappers)
- Comprehensive logging via MistKitLogger

I'm ready to help you search through the codebase. What would you like me to find?

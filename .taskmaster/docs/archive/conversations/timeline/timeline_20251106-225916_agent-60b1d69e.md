I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase. I can help you find files, search for code patterns, or analyze specific parts of the project.

What would you like me to search for? For example, I can:
- Find files matching specific patterns (e.g., "all Swift test files")
- Search for specific code or text within files (e.g., "CloudKit authentication implementations")
- Locate and read specific files you need to review
- Explore directory structures

What search task would you like me to help with?

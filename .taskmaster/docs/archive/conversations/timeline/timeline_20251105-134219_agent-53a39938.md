### 13:42:24 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with searching and analyzing the MistKit-Bushel codebase. I have access to the project context including:

- **Current branch**: `blog-post-examples-code-bushel`
- **Working directory**: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit-Bushel`
- **Recent changes**: Modified files in Bushel demo including Package.swift, Scripts, SyncCommand.swift, and DataSourcePipeline.swift
- **Project focus**: MistKit - a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services, with a Bushel demo application

I understand the project's architecture:
- OpenAPI-driven CloudKit Web Services client
- Modern Swift concurrency patterns (async/await)
- Protocol-oriented design with dependency injection
- Comprehensive documentation in `.claude/docs/`

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Search code content with regex
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate the codebase efficiently
- Report findings with absolute file paths and code snippets

What would you like me to search for or analyze in the codebase?

I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search through code, and analyze the project structure.

What would you like me to search for? Some examples of what I can help with:

- Finding specific files or patterns (e.g., "Find all Swift test files")
- Searching for code patterns or implementations (e.g., "Find where CloudKit authentication is handled")
- Locating configuration files or documentation
- Finding files related to specific features or components

What are you looking for?

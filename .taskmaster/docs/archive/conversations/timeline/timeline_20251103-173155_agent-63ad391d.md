I'm Claude Code, ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit codebase. I have access to the project context and understand:

- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code
- **Key Files**: OpenAPI spec, Swift source code, tests, and documentation
- **Development Stack**: Swift Package Manager, async/await, modern Swift features

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns and regex
- Read and analyze code
- Explore the codebase structure
- Help with CloudKit Web Services integration

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit project?

### 19:33:36 - USER
Explore the Examples/Celestra/ directory to understand what has already been implemented:

1. **Project Structure**: What directories and files exist? What's the organization?

2. **Package.swift**: What dependencies are configured? What products and targets exist?

3. **Schema (schema.ckdb)**: What CloudKit record types have been defined? What fields and relationships exist?

4. **Source Code**: 
   - What's in Sources/Celestra/?
   - Are there Models, CloudKit integration, DataSources, Commands?
   - What has been implemented vs what's still missing?

5. **Documentation**: Read README.md and CLOUDKIT_SCHEMA_SETUP.md to understand setup status

6. **Scripts**: What automation scripts exist?

7. **Current State Assessment**:
   - What from Task 6 (subtasks 6.1, 6.2, 6.3) has been completed?
   - What still needs to be implemented?
   - Are there any TODOs or incomplete sections?

Return a comprehensive summary of:
- What's been implemented
- What's missing or incomplete
- Current status relative to Task 6's subtasks
- Recommended next steps based on what exists

### 19:33:40 - ASSISTANT
I'll explore the Examples/Celestra/ directory to understand what has been implemented and assess the current state relative to Task 6.

### 19:34:01 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check if there are any test files or additional documentation:

### 19:34:01 - ASSISTANT
[Glob: Examples/Celestra/.env*]
[Glob: Examples/Celestra/Tests/**/*]
[Bash: Find documentation and TODO files in Cel]
[Read: .env.example]
[Bash: Check if Celestra package can build]

### 19:34:13 - ASSISTANT
Let me check the Task 6 details to compare:

### 19:34:13 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Find Task 6 details in tasks.json]

### 19:35:31 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me create a detailed summary report.

## Comprehensive Celestra Implementation Summary

### Project Structure

The Celestra example is a **complete, production-ready RSS reader CLI** that demonstrates MistKit's CloudKit integration capabilities. The project is well-organized with the following structure:

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. CloudKit Schema Design (Task 6.1 - ✅ COMPLETE)

**CloudKit Record Types:**

- **PublicFeed**: Stores RSS feed metadata
  - `feedURL` (String, queryable/sortable) - RSS feed URL
  - `title` (String) - Feed title
  - `totalAttempts` (Int64) - Total fetch attempts
  - `successfulAttempts` (Int64) - Successful fetches
  - `usageCount` (Int64, queryable/sortable) - Popularity metric
  - `lastAttempted` (Timestamp, queryable/sor

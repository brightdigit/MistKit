### 21:10:48 - USER
Search .claude/docs/webservices.md for the complete list of CloudKit field types. Find the section that lists all valid field type constants like STRING, INT64, DOUBLE, BYTES, TIMESTAMP, LOCATION, REFERENCE, ASSET, etc. I need to verify whether there is a BOOLEAN type or if booleans are represented differently in CloudKit.

### 21:10:49 - ASSISTANT
I'll search for the CloudKit field types section in the webservices documentation.

### 21:10:49 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "field type|BOOLEAN|INT64|STRIN" in docs]

### 21:10:54 - ASSISTANT
Let me search more specifically for the field types section in webservices.md:

### 21:10:54 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "Field Types|type.*constant|val" in webservices.md]

### 21:10:58 - ASSISTANT
Let me search for the actual field type definitions:

### 21:10:58 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "TIMESTAMP|DATE" in webservices.md]
[Grep: "\btype\b.*\bvalue\b|field.*dic" in webservices.md]

### 21:11:05 - ASSISTANT
Let me read the relevant section about Record Field Dictionary:

### 21:11:05 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "Record Field Dictionary|field " in webservices.md]

### 21:11:09 - ASSISTANT
Now let me find the actual "Record Field Dictionary" section:

### 21:11:09 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Find line number for Record Field Dictio]

### 21:11:12 - ASSISTANT
Let me search for where field types are actually defined:

### 21:11:12 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Find references to field type constants]

### 21:11:17 - ASSISTANT
Let me check the QUICK_REFERENCE.md more carefully since it had the field types:

### 21:11:17 - ASSISTANT
[Read: QUICK_REFERENCE.md]

### 21:11:21 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Let me also check if there's any mention of BOOLEAN anywhere in the docs:

### 21:11:21 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Search for any boolean type references]

### 21:11:26 - ASSISTANT
Let me also check the cloudkitjs.md for any boolean field type information:

### 21:11:26 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Search cloudkitjs for boolean references]

### 21:11:30 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check the openapi.yaml to see how CloudKit actually handles field types:

### 21:11:30 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Search openapi.yaml for field type defin]

### 21:11:34 - ASSISTANT
Interesting! Let me get more context from the openapi.yaml:

### 21:11:34 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "BooleanValue|FieldValue" in openapi.yaml]

### 21:11:50 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now I have all the information. Let me provide you with a comprehensive answer:

## CloudKit Field Types - Complete List

Based on my search through the documentation, here's what I found:

### **From the QUICK_REFERENCE.md** (Official CloudKit Web Services)
The complete list of CloudKit field types is:

**Scalar Types:**
- `STRING` - Text string
- `INT64` - Integer (64-bit)
- `DOUBLE` - Floating point number
- `BYTES` - Binary data (base64 encoded)
- `DATE` - Timestamp (milliseconds since epoch)
- `LOCATION` - Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- `REFERENCE` - Reference to another record
- `ASSET` - File attachment

**List Types:**
- `STRING_LIST` - Array of strings
- `INT64_LIST` - Array of integers
- `DOUBLE_LIST` - Array of doubles
- `DATE_LIST` - Array of dates
- `LOCATION_LIST` - Array of locations
- `REFERENCE_LIST` - Array of references

### **Important Finding: BOOLEAN Type**

**There is NO `BOOLEAN` field type** in the official CloudKit Web Services REST API documentation (`webservices.md` and `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`).

**However**, the `openapi.yaml` file in this project **DOES include a `BooleanValue`** type, which suggests that:

1. The OpenAPI spec was created/extended to support boolean values
2. This may be a custom addition to the spec or
3. CloudKit may support booleans but they're not well-documented in the official REST API docs

**From openapi.yaml:**
```yaml
FieldValue:
  properties:
    value:
      oneOf:
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/BooleanValue'
        # ... other types
    type:
      type: string
      enum: [STRING, INT64, DOUBLE, BYTES, REFERENCE, ASSET, ASSETID, LOCATION, TIMESTAMP, LIST]
```

**Notice:** While `BooleanValue` is defined as a valid value schema, **BOOLEAN is NOT in the `type` enum**. This is inconsistent.

### **Recommendation**

For CloudKit Web Services compatibility, booleans are typically represented as:
- **`INT64`** with values `0` (false) or `1` (true), or
- **`STRING`** with values `"fal

I'm ready to help you with your search needs in the MistKit-Predicates codebase. I've reviewed the context about this Swift package for CloudKit Web Services and understand the project structure, development commands, and architectural approach.

The project is a fresh rewrite using modern Swift features (async/await, structured concurrency, actors) with an OpenAPI-driven development approach. I'm familiar with:

- The package structure and file organization
- Development workflows and Swift commands
- Architecture principles (protocol-oriented, dependency injection, error handling)
- Testing strategy using Swift Testing framework
- CloudKit Web Services integration patterns
- Task Master integration for development workflow

I'm equipped to:
- Use glob patterns to find files
- Search code and text with regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Provide absolute file paths in results
- Navigate the codebase efficiently

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit-Predicates codebase?

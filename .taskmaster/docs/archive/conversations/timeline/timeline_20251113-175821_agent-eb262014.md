I'm ready to help you with file search and code exploration in the MistKit project. I have access to the project context and understand:

- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Working Directory**: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit
- **Project Status**: Clean git state with recent commits focused on testing and refactoring

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns for broad matching
- Search code contents with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Perform file operations with bash
- Navigate the codebase efficiently

I understand the project structure includes:
- Swift source files in `Sources/MistKit/`
- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`
- OpenAPI specification and generation scripts
- Task Master integration for development workflow
- Comprehensive documentation in `.claude/docs/`

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit codebase?

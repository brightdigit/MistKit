I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase. I can help you find files, search through code content, read specific files, and navigate the project structure.

Based on the context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with:
- Swift source code in `Sources/MistKit/`
- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`
- OpenAPI specification in `openapi.yaml`
- Generated code in `Sources/MistKit/Generated/` (not committed)
- Scripts in `Scripts/`

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

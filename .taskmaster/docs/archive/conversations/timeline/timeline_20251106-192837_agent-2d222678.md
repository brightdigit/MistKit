I'm ready to help you search and navigate the MistKit codebase. I can help you find files, search through code, read specific files, and explore the project structure.

Based on the context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with:
- Main code in `Sources/MistKit/`
- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`
- OpenAPI specification in `openapi.yaml`
- Generated code directory at `Sources/MistKit/Generated/`

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase?

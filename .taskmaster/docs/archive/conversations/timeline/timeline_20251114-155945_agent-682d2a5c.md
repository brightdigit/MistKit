Warmup

### 15:59:49 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist with your codebase exploration and file searches in the MistKit project. I have access to the project context and understand the architecture, development workflow, and project guidelines.

I can help you:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate the codebase structure
- Find implementations, tests, and documentation

I'm aware of:
- The project is a Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services
- Current branch: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`
- Main branch for PRs: `main`
- The codebase uses modern Swift features (async/await, Swift Testing)
- Key files: `openapi.yaml`, `CLAUDE.md`, project instructions
- Task Master integration for development workflow

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit project?

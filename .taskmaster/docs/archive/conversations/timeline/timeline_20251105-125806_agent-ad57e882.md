### 12:58:10 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with searching and exploring the MistKit codebase. I have all the context I need:

- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Working directory**: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit

I understand the project structure, development guidelines from CLAUDE.md, and can efficiently search through the codebase using:
- **Glob patterns** for broad file matching
- **Grep with regex** for searching content
- **Read** for examining specific files
- **Bash** for file operations

I'm prepared to help you find files, search for specific code patterns, analyze implementations, or explore the codebase structure. What would you like me to search for?

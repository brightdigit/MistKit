### 01:10:27 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist! I'm Claude Code, and I have access to the MistKit repository at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`.

I understand the project context:
- **MistKit** is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- Currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch
- Uses modern Swift features (async/await, structured concurrency, actors)
- Driven by OpenAPI specification
- Has comprehensive documentation in `.claude/docs/`
- Task Master integration available for workflow management

I'm ready to help you with:
- File searching and code analysis using glob patterns and regex
- Reading and understanding the codebase
- Finding specific implementations or patterns
- Navigating the project structure
- Any development tasks following the CLAUDE.md guidelines

What would you like me to help you with?

I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit-Bushel codebase! I can see this is a CloudKit Web Services project with some recent changes on the `pr132-code-review-fixes` branch.

From the git status, I can see:
- Modified files in the Bushel example project (Package.swift, BushelCloudKitService.swift, etc.)
- A new untracked file: RecordTypeSet.swift
- Recent commits focused on Phase 5 documentation and refactoring to protocol-oriented design

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

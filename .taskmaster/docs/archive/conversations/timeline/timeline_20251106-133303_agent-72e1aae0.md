I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you explore and work with the MistKit-Bushel codebase.

I understand the context:
- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-bushel
- **Working Directory**: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit-Bushel
- **Repository State**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)

I have access to the project instructions in CLAUDE.md and the Task Master AI workflow guide. I can help with:

1. **File exploration and code search** - Finding files, searching code patterns, analyzing structure
2. **Code reading and analysis** - Understanding implementation details
3. **Development workflows** - Following the Swift package patterns and best practices outlined
4. **Task management** - Using Task Master commands if needed

I'm ready to assist with any questions about the codebase, help you navigate the project structure, or search for specific implementations. What would you like to explore?

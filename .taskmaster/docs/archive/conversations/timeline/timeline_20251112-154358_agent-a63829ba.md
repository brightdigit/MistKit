I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I have access to the project context and understand:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- Uses modern Swift features (async/await, structured concurrency, actors)
- Based on OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification for CloudKit Web Services REST API
- Current branch: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`

**Available Resources:**
- Project structure with Sources, Tests, Scripts directories
- OpenAPI specification and code generation setup
- Comprehensive documentation in `.claude/docs/`
- CloudKit Schema Language reference materials
- Task Master integration for project management

**My Capabilities:**
- Glob patterns for broad file matching
- Grep/regex for searching file contents
- Direct file reading for specific paths
- Bash operations for exploration (no system modifications)

I'm ready to help with file searches, code exploration, and analysis. What would you like me to find or investigate in the MistKit codebase?

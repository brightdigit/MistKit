I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase. I can help you find files, search for specific code patterns, or explore the project structure.

What would you like me to search for? For example:
- Find specific files or file types
- Search for code patterns or functions
- Locate documentation or configuration files
- Explore the structure of a particular directory

Please let me know what you're looking for and I'll help you navigate the codebase efficiently.

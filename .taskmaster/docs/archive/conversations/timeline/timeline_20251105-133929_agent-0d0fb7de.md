I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit-Bushel codebase. I can see this is a Swift project with CloudKit integration, and there's a Bushel demo application that appears to be working with IPSW images and CloudKit records.

I notice from the git status that you have:
- Modified files in the Bushel example project
- An untracked `BushelIPSW/` directory
- An untracked `TheAppleWiki/` data source directory

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

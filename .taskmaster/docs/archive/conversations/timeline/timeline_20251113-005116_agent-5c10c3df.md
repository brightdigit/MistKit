I'm Claude Code, ready to assist you with the MistKit project. I have access to the project context and understand the key information:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- Built with modern Swift features (async/await, structured concurrency, actors)
- Currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch
- Uses swift-log for cross-platform logging

**Key Tools Available:**
- File search with Glob patterns
- Code search with Grep and regex
- File reading and analysis
- Bash operations for directory navigation

**Important Guidelines:**
- I'll use absolute file paths in responses
- I won't modify your system state
- I'll communicate clearly without emojis
- I'll follow the project's CLAUDE.md instructions

I'm ready to help you navigate the MistKit codebase, search for files, analyze code, and support your development work. What would you like me to help you with?

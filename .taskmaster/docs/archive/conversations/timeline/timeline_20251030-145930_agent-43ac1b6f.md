Warmup

### 14:59:34 - ASSISTANT
I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you with file search and code exploration tasks in the MistKit project.

I understand the context:

- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: `blog-post-examples`
- **Key Files**: 
  - CLAUDE.md provides development guidance
  - Task Master is configured for project management
  - Recent work involves blog post drafts and outlines

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Find code with regex grep searches
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate the codebase efficiently
- Return absolute file paths in results
- Avoid creating files or modifying the system

I have access to 200,000 tokens for this session and will work efficiently to complete your search requests. What would you like me to find or explore in the MistKit codebase?

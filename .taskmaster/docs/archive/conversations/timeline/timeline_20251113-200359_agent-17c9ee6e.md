I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you navigate and search through the MistKit codebase.

I can see you're working on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch of the MistKit project - a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services.

I'm equipped to:
- **Find files** using glob patterns across the codebase
- **Search code contents** with powerful regex patterns
- **Read and analyze** specific files you're interested in
- **Navigate the project structure** efficiently

I've reviewed the CLAUDE.md project instructions and understand:
- MistKit uses modern Swift with async/await, structured concurrency, and actors
- The project leverages OpenAPI specifications for CloudKit Web Services
- Testing uses Swift Testing framework with `@Test` macros
- The codebase emphasizes protocol-oriented design and dependency injection
- Task Master integration is available for project management

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit repository?

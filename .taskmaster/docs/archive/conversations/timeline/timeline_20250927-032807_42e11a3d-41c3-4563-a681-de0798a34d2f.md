The GitHub Actions workflow failed because **CodeQL detected Swift code but couldn't process any of it**. This is a common issue when:

1. **Swift version compatibility** - The recent commit mentions "Updating CodeQL for Swift 6.1 Support", suggesting the CodeQL configuration may not be properly set up for Swift 6.1
2. **Build configuration issues** - CodeQL couldn't analyze the Swift code during the build process
3. **Missing or incorrect CodeQL configuration** - The workflow may need updated CodeQL settings for the newer Swift version

Looking at your recent commits, this appears related to the Swift 6.1 update. You'll likely need to:
- Update the CodeQL workflow configuration 
- Ensure the Swift build process is compatible with CodeQL analysis
- Possibly update the CodeQL action version in `.github/workflows/MistKit.yml`

## Research Summary

The CodeQL failure is caused by **missing CodeQL workflow configuration** in your GitHub Actions. Your current workflow only has build and lint jobs but **no CodeQL security scanning job**.

### Key Findings:

1. **Current Issue**: Your `.github/workflows/MistKit.yml` has no CodeQL configuration, but GitHub is trying to run CodeQL analysis (likely via default setup)

2. **Xcode Compatibility**: The error often occurs with Xcode 16.0/26.0. Your workflow uses Xcode 26.0 and 16.x versions which can cause this specific issue

3. **Swift 6.1 Support**: CodeQL 2.21.2+ supports Swift 6.1, so version compatibility isn't the issue

### Solution Options:

**Option 1: Add proper CodeQL workflow**
```yaml
codeql:
  name: CodeQL Analysis
  runs-on: macos-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
      with:
        languages: swift
    - name: Build Swift Package
      run: swift build
    - uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
```

**Option 2: Disable default CodeQL** if you don't want security scanning

**Option 3: Use compatible Xcode version** (15.4 instead of 26.0/16.x) for CodeQL jobs

The most likely cause is GitHub's default CodeQL setup trying to analyze your Swift code without proper build configuration.

Updated the existing CodeQL workflow to use:
- `macos-15` runner instead of `macos-26`
- `Xcode_16.4.app` instead of `Xcode_26.0.app`

This should fix the "CodeQL detected code written in Swift but could not process any of it" error by using a compatible Xcode version that works with CodeQL analysis.

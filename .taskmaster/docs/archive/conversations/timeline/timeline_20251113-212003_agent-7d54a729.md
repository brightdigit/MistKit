I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I'm a file search specialist for Claude Code, equipped to efficiently navigate and explore your project.

I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services access, currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch with a clean git status.

What would you like me to search for? I can help you:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Locate documentation or examples

Just let me know what you're looking for and how thorough you'd like the search to be!

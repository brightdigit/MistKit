I'm ready to help you search and explore the MistKit codebase! I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services access, currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch.

From the context, I understand:
- This is a modern Swift rewrite on the `claude` branch (though git shows we're on `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`)
- The project provides server-side and CLI access to CloudKit Web Services
- It uses OpenAPI specifications for code generation
- Recent commits show work on Celestra documentation and CloudKit schema management

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase? I can:
- Search for specific files, functions, or code patterns
- Explore the project structure and organization
- Find examples of particular implementations
- Locate documentation or configuration files
- Analyze code relationships and dependencies

Just let me know what you're looking for!

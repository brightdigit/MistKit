Warmup

### 15:15:14 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with file searches, code exploration, and navigation through the MistKit-Celestra codebase. I have the project context loaded and understand the key aspects of this Swift package for CloudKit Web Services.

I can help you with:

- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code with regex patterns
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Exploring the project structure
- Locating specific implementations or references

I'm aware of:
- This is a fresh rewrite of MistKit on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch
- The project uses OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`) as the foundation
- Modern Swift features like async/await, structured concurrency, and actors
- The project has documentation in `.claude/docs/` for reference
- Task Master integration for project management

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit-Predicates codebase! I can help you find files, search code contents, and analyze the structure of this CloudKit Web Services Swift package.

What would you like me to search for? Some things I can help with:

- Finding specific files or file patterns
- Searching for code patterns or implementations
- Locating where specific types, protocols, or functions are defined
- Analyzing directory structure
- Finding test files or documentation

What are you looking for?

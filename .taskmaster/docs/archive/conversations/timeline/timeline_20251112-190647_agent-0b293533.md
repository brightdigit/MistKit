I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I'm a file search specialist for Claude Code, and I can help you:

- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex (grep)
- Read specific files
- Navigate and explore the codebase

I can see you're working in the `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit` directory on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch.

What would you like me to help you find or search for in the codebase?

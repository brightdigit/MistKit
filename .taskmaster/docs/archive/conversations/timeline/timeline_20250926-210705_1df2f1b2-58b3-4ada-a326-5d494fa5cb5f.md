Remove support for Swift 6.0

### 21:07:12 - ASSISTANT
I'll help you remove support for Swift 6.0 from the MistKit project. Let me first examine the current project structure to understand what needs to be changed.

No need to edit Package.swift. Just delete @Package@swift-5.10.swift

### 21:08:41 - ASSISTANT
I understand. I see there's a `Package@swift-5.10.swift` file that should be deleted, and the main `Package.swift` already uses Swift 6.1 tools version (which is fine to keep). Let me update my plan:

### 21:10:18 - ASSISTANT
Successfully removed Swift 6.0 and Xcode 16.2 support from MistKit:

✅ Deleted `Package@swift-5.10.swift` file  
✅ Removed Swift 6.0 from CI workflow matrix  
✅ Removed both Xcode 16.2 entries from CI workflow  
✅ Updated `.spi.yml` to use Swift 6.1 instead of 6.0  
✅ Removed Swift 6.0 devcontainer configuration

The project now supports Swift 6.1+ and Xcode 16.3+ while maintaining all other version support.

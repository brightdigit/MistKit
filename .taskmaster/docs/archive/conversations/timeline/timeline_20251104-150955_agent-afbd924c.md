Warmup

### 15:10:01 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with file search and exploration in the MistKit project. I can help you:

- Find files using glob patterns
- Search through code with regex patterns
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate the codebase efficiently

The project is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services access, currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch.

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search code, and explore the project structure.

As a file search specialist, I can:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate the codebase thoroughly

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the MistKit project?

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for working with codebases. I'm ready to help you explore and work with the MistKit-RecordBuilder project.

I have context about:
- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: pr132-code-review-fixes-recordbuilder
- **Key Setup**: Modern Swift with async/await, structured concurrency, and OpenAPI-driven development
- **Task Management**: Task Master integration available for structured development workflows

I can help you with:
- File searching and exploration using glob patterns and regex
- Code analysis and understanding
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Navigation of the codebase structure

What would you like to explore or work on in the MistKit-RecordBuilder project?

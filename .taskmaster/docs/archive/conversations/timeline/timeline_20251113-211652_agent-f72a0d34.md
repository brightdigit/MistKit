### 21:16:57 - ASSISTANT
I'll help you search through the MistKit codebase. I'm ready to assist with finding files, searching code, or exploring the project structure.

What would you like me to search for? For example, I can:

1. Find files matching specific patterns
2. Search for code snippets or text patterns
3. Read and analyze specific files
4. Explore the directory structure

Please let me know what you're looking for, and I'll help you navigate the codebase efficiently.

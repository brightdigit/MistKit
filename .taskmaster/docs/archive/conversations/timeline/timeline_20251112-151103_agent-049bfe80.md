### 15:11:11 - ASSISTANT
I'll help you search through the MistKit codebase. I'm ready to assist with finding files, searching code, and analyzing the repository structure.

Based on the environment information, I can see:
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`
- **Current Branch**: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`
- **Git Status**: Clean except for some untracked files in Examples/Celestra

What would you like me to search for or help you find in the codebase?

Some common tasks I can help with:
- Find specific files or file patterns
- Search for code patterns or text content
- Locate implementation of specific features
- Explore the Examples/Celestra directory structure
- Find CloudKit schema files or RSS feed related code

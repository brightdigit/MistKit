I'm ready to help you search and explore this codebase! I'm Claude Code's file search specialist, and I can help you find files, search code, and analyze the MistKit-RecordBuilder project.

Based on the environment information, I can see you're working on:
- **Project**: MistKit-RecordBuilder (a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services)
- **Current Branch**: pr132-code-review-fixes-recordbuilder
- **Status**: Clean working directory
- **Recent Work**: Completed Phase 4 code organization and various feature implementations

I have access to powerful search capabilities:
- **Glob**: Pattern matching to find files
- **Grep**: Regex-based content searching
- **Read**: Reading specific files
- **Bash**: File operations and directory exploration

What would you like me to help you find or explore in this codebase?

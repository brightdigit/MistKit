I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search for specific code patterns, or read file contents.

What would you like me to search for? Some examples of what I can do:

- Find files matching specific patterns (e.g., "Find all Swift test files")
- Search for code containing specific text or patterns (e.g., "Find all references to CloudKit authentication")
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate the codebase structure

What are you looking for?

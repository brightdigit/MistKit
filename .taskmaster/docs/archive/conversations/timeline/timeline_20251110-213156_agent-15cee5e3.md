I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search code contents, and explore the project structure.

Based on the environment information, I can see:
- Working directory: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`
- Current branch: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`
- The repository is clean with recent commits related to Celestra implementation

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

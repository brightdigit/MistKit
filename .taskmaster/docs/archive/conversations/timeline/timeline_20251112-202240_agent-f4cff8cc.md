I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you search and explore the MistKit codebase efficiently.

I have the project context loaded:
- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: feature/swift-log-migration
- **Working Directory**: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin)

I understand the project structure, development commands, and best practices including:
- Swift async/await patterns for network operations
- Swift-log integration for cross-platform logging
- OpenAPI-driven development approach
- Swift Testing framework for tests
- Task Master integration for development workflows

I'm equipped to:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code content with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Perform bash operations for file exploration
- Navigate the codebase thoroughly

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit codebase?

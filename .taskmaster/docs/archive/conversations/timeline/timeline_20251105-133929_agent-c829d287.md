I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you navigate and search through the MistKit-Bushel codebase.

I can see this is a Swift package project for CloudKit Web Services integration, currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch with recent work on automated CloudKit schema setup and demo implementations.

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns and regex
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate the project structure
- Help you understand the codebase

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit-Bushel project?

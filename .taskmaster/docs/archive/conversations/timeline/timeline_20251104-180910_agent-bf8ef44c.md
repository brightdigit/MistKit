I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, ready to help you explore and work with the MistKit codebase. I have access to the project context including:

- **MistKit**: A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`
- **Key Files**: CLAUDE.md with project guidelines, Task Master integration, and development workflows
- **Recent Work**: Enhanced MistKit with query filtering and sorting support, documentation on OpenAPI code generation

I'm prepared to:
- Search and navigate the codebase using glob patterns and grep
- Read and analyze file contents
- Help with Swift package development following the project's modern Swift practices (async/await, structured concurrency, Actors, etc.)
- Reference the OpenAPI specification for CloudKit Web Services
- Support development workflows with Task Master integration

What would you like me to help you with in the MistKit project?

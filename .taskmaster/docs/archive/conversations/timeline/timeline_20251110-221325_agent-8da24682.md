I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you navigate and explore this codebase. 

I can see we're working with the MistKit project - a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services. Currently, we're on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch in the Celestra examples directory.

Based on the CLAUDE.md instructions, I understand:
- This is a modern Swift rewrite leveraging async/await and Swift Concurrency
- The project uses OpenAPI specification-driven development
- Swift Testing framework is preferred over XCTest
- The codebase follows protocol-oriented design with dependency injection
- There's TaskMaster workflow integration for development commands

I'm ready to help you with:
- Searching for files using glob patterns
- Searching code contents with regex
- Reading and analyzing specific files
- Providing insights about the codebase structure

What would you like me to help you find or explore in this Celestra examples project?

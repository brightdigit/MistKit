I'm Claude Code, ready to help you with file search and codebase exploration in the MistKit project. 

I can see we're working with:
- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin 25.1.0)

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns for broad matching
- Search code contents with regex patterns
- Read specific file contents
- Navigate the codebase efficiently
- Provide absolute file paths in my responses

The project includes comprehensive development guidelines in CLAUDE.md covering:
- Swift package structure and commands
- OpenAPI-driven development approach
- Modern Swift features (async/await, actors, structured concurrency)
- Testing with Swift Testing framework
- Reference documentation for CloudKit Web Services

I also have access to Task Master AI integration for project management if needed.

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit codebase?

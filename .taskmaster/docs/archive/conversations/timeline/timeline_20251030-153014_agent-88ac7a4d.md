### 15:30:18 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with the MistKit project. I have access to the project context, including:

- **Project Structure**: Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services REST API access
- **Current Branch**: `blog-post-examples` (with some file renames pending)
- **Development Guidelines**: Modern Swift with async/await, structured concurrency, and OpenAPI-driven development
- **Key Resources**: OpenAPI specification, reference documentation in `.claude/docs/`, and Task Master integration

I can help you with:

- Searching and exploring the codebase using glob patterns and regex
- Reading and analyzing specific files
- Understanding the project architecture and implementation patterns
- Navigating the CloudKit Web Services integration
- Working with Task Master for project organization and task tracking

What would you like me to help you with today?

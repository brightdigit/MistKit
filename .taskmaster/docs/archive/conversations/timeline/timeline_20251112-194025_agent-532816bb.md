Warmup

### 19:40:34 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase. I can assist you with:

- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code contents with regex (grep)
- Reading specific files
- Navigating the project structure

The codebase is located at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit` and appears to be a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services integration.

What would you like me to search for or help you find?

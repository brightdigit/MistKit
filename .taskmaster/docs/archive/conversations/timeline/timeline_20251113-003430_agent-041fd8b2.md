I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit codebase efficiently.

I understand the project context:
- **MistKit**: A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Key Tech**: Swift concurrency (async/await), swift-log for logging, OpenAPI-driven development
- **Architecture**: Protocol-oriented, dependency injection, typed errors, Sendable compliance

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns and regex grep
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate the codebase structure
- Help with Swift implementation details

I also have access to Task Master for project management if needed, though I'll focus on code exploration unless you specify otherwise.

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit codebase?

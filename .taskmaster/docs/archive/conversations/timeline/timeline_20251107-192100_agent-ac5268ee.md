I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can assist with finding files, searching code contents, and analyzing the project structure.

Based on the context provided, I can see that MistKit is a Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services integration. The project includes:

- Swift source code in `Sources/MistKit/`
- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`
- OpenAPI specifications and generation scripts
- Task Master AI integration for project management

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

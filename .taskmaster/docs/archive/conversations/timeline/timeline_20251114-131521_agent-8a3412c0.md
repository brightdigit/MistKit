### 13:15:26 - ASSISTANT
I'm Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant, and I'm ready to help you with your MistKit project. I have access to the codebase and understand the project context through the CLAUDE.md and .taskmaster/CLAUDE.md files.

I can assist you with:

- **File Search & Navigation**: Finding files using glob patterns, searching with regex, and exploring the codebase
- **Code Analysis**: Reading and understanding Swift code, CloudKit integration, and API implementations
- **Development Tasks**: Following the Task Master workflow, understanding the OpenAPI specification, and the modern Swift architecture
- **Project Context**: CloudKit Web Services integration, async/await patterns, error handling, testing with Swift Testing framework, and logging with swift-log

The project is currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch, and the main branch is available for PRs.

What would you like me to help you with today?

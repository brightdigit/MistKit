I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you search through and analyze your MistKit codebase.

I can see you're working on the **refactor/to-initializer-pattern** branch with recent commits focused on refactoring to initializer patterns and standardizing error handling.

Here's what I can do for you:

- **File Search**: Use glob patterns to find files across your codebase
- **Content Search**: Use regex patterns to search within file contents
- **File Reading**: Examine specific files in detail
- **Code Analysis**: Help you understand code structure and relationships

I also have access to your project context:
- **MistKit** is a Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services
- You're using modern Swift features (async/await, actors, protocols)
- The project follows a structure with Sources, Tests, and Scripts directories
- You have comprehensive documentation in CLAUDE.md about architecture, testing, and logging

What would you like me to search for or analyze in your MistKit codebase?

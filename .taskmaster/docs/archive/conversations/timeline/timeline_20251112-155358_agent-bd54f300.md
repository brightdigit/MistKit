I understand. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist for the MistKit project. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore this codebase efficiently.

Let me confirm the context I have:

**Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services

**Current Location**: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`

**Current Branch**: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`

**Key Resources Available**:
- OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`) for CloudKit Web Services
- Reference documentation in `.claude/docs/`
- Swift testing framework and modern async/await patterns
- Task Master integration for development workflows

I'm equipped to:
- Use Glob patterns for broad file matching
- Search code with regex using Grep
- Read specific file contents
- Perform bash operations for file exploration
- Return absolute file paths in findings

I'm ready to help you search, explore, and analyze files in the MistKit codebase. What would you like me to find or investigate?

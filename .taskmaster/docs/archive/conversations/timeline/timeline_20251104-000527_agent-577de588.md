### 00:05:27 - USER
I need to verify what data is available from the macOS restore image sources to ensure the CloudKit schema can be populated.

Please investigate:

1. **Fetch and analyze the MESU XML**:
   - URL: https://mesu.apple.com/assets/macos/com_apple_macOSIPSW/com_apple_macOSIPSW.xml
   - What fields are available? (version, build, URL, filesize, SHA256, signing status, etc.)
   - Sample a few entries to see the data structure

2. **Check Mr. Macintosh database**:
   - URL: https://mrmacintosh.com/apple-silicon-m1-full-macos-restore-ipsw-firmware-files-database/
   - What metadata does this provide beyond MESU?
   - Does it track signing status?

3. **Review IPSWDownloads package** (if docs exist in the project):
   - What fields does the IPSWDownloads Swift package provide?
   - Does it have signing status, SHA256 hashes, etc.?

4. **Check MobileAsset/Firmware wiki pages**:
   - URLs provided: https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/MobileAsset and https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/Firmware
   - What additional metadata do these document?

Compare available data against the RestoreImage schema fields:
- version ✓/✗
- buildNumber ✓/✗
- releaseDate ✓/✗
- downloadURL ✓/✗
- fileSize ✓/✗
- sha256Hash ✓/✗
- isSigned ✓/✗
- isPrerelease ✓/✗
- source ✓/✗

Identify any schema fields that cannot be populated from available sources, and suggest alternatives or adjustments.

Set thoroughness to "medium".

### 00:05:31 - ASSISTANT
I'll investigate the available data sources to verify what fields can populate the CloudKit schema. Let me start by fetching and analyzing each source.

### 00:05:31 - ASSISTANT
[WebFetch: mesu.apple.com]
[WebFetch: mrmacintosh.com]
[WebFetch: theapplewiki.com]
[WebFetch: theapplewiki.com]

### 00:06:17 - ASSISTANT
Let me check if there's any existing documentation or code in the project about IPSWDownloads or restore image data:

### 00:06:17 - ASSISTANT
[Glob: **/*IPSW*]
[Glob: **/*restore*]
[Grep: "IPSWDownloads|MESU|MobileAsset" in ]

### 00:06:22 - ASSISTANT
Let me search for any schema definitions or CloudKit-related files:

### 00:06:22 - ASSISTANT
[Glob: **/*{schema,Schema,CloudKit}*]
[Grep: "RestoreImage|sha256|isSigned|i" in ]
[Glob: **/*.md]

### 00:06:26 - ASSISTANT
Let me check documentation files that might describe the schema:

### 00:06:26 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "RestoreImage" in ]
[Bash: Find markdown files mentioning schema or]

### 00:06:37 - ASSISTANT
Let me check the blog post drafts which might contain the schema information:

### 00:06:37 - ASSISTANT
[Read: blog-post-draft-claude.md]
[Read: openapi-cloudkit-schemas.md]

### 00:06:42 - ASSISTANT
Now let me search for any schema or documentation mentioning the RestoreImage schema:

### 00:06:42 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: List markdown files in taskmaster direct]
[Grep: "version|buildNumber|releaseDat" in docs]
[Read: prd.txt]

### 00:06:51 - ASSISTANT
Now let me search for mentions of "Bushel" to understand the RestoreImage schema:

### 00:06:51 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "Bushel|RestoreImage|IPSW|resto" in .taskmaster]

### 00:07:41 - ASSISTANT
Based on my investigation, I now have enough information to provide a comprehensive analysis. Let me compile the findings.

## Data Source Verification Analysis

Based on my investigation of the available data sources for macOS restore images, here's what I found:

### 1. MESU XML (Apple's Official Source)
**URL**: https://mesu.apple.com/assets/macos/com_apple_macOSIPSW/com_apple_macOSIPSW.xml

**Available Fields**:
- ✅ **BuildVersion** - Build identifier (e.g., "25B78")
- ✅ **ProductVersion** - OS version number (e.g., "26.1")
- ✅ **FirmwareURL** - Direct download URL to .ipsw file
- ✅ **FirmwareSHA1** - SHA-1 hash for integrity verification
- ✅ **EpochVersion** - Version epoch marker (value: 1)
- ⚠️ **DocumentationURL** - Support documentation link (currently empty in all entries)

**Missing Fields**:
- ❌ **SHA256 hash** - Only SHA-1 is provided
- ❌ **File size** - Not included in XML
- ❌ **Release date** - No timestamp information
- ❌ **Signing status** - Not tracked
- ❌ **Prerelease indicator** - No beta/RC classification

### 2. Mr. Macintosh Database
**URL**: https://mrmacintosh.com/apple-silicon-m1-full-macos-restore-ipsw-firmware-files-database/

**Available Fields**:
- ✅ **Version number** (e.g., "26.1", "15.6.1")
- ✅ **Build identifier** (e.g., "25B78", "24G90")
- ✅ **Release date** (formatted as MM/DD or MM/DD/YY)
- ✅ **Download URL** (hosted on Apple's CDN)
- ✅ **Signing status** ("YES" or "N/A" columns)
- ✅ **Device compatibility notes** (e.g., "M5 14″ MBPro ONLY")
- ✅ **Release classification** (Final, RC, Beta with numbering)

**Missing Fields**:
- ❌ **SHA256 hashes** - Not provided
- ❌ **File sizes** - Despite being mentioned in page description, not actually included

### 3. TheAppleWiki (MobileAsset & Firmware)
**Status**: Both wiki pages returned **403 Forbidden** errors, so no data could be retrieved.

### 4. IPSWDownloads Package
**Status**: No documentation or references found in the project. This package may not be in use or documented yet.

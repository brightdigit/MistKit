I'm ready to help you with your MistKit project. I have context on:

1. **Project Overview**: MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services, written in modern Swift with async/await, structured concurrency, and protocol-oriented design.

2. **Key Resources Available**:
   - OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`) as the source of truth for CloudKit Web Services API
   - Reference documentation in `.claude/docs/` for CloudKit Web Services, CloudKit JS, Swift Testing, and Swift OpenAPI Generator
   - Swift development commands and workflows
   - Code generation scripts for OpenAPI

3. **Project Context**:
   - Currently on branch: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`
   - Main branch: `main`
   - Repository is clean with no uncommitted changes
   - Recent work includes directory reorganization and query/sorting enhancements

4. **Development Standards**:
   - Swift Concurrency (async/await) for all network operations
   - Swift Testing framework with `@Test` macros
   - Protocol-oriented design with dependency injection
   - Explicit ACLs in Swift code
   - Type order based on SwiftLint defaults
   - Task Master AI integration for task management

I'm ready to search files, analyze code, help with implementation, or assist with any other aspects of the MistKit project. What would you like me to help you with?

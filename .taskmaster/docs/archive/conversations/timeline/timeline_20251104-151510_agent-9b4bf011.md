Warmup

### 15:15:16 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to help you search and explore the MistKit-Celestra codebase. I can assist with:

- **Finding files** using glob patterns
- **Searching code** with regex patterns (grep)
- **Reading file contents** when you know the specific path
- **Running bash commands** for file operations

Based on the context, I can see this is a Swift package project for CloudKit Web Services integration, currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch.

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase?

### 21:50:35 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with code exploration and search tasks in the MistKit-Bushel project. I have good context about the codebase and the project structure.

Based on the git status, I can see you're on the `pr132-code-review-fixes` branch with recent changes to CloudKit-related files, including a new `RecordTypeSet.swift` file that hasn't been committed yet.

I can help you with:
- **File searches** using glob patterns
- **Content searches** with regex patterns
- **Code analysis** and navigation
- **Reading and exploring** specific files

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

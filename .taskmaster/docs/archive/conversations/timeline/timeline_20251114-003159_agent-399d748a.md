### 00:32:02 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with searching and analyzing the MistKit codebase. I have context about the project structure, development guidelines, and current branch status.

Key information I understand:
- **Project**: MistKit - a Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: `feature/server-generated-record-names`
- **Modified File**: `Sources/MistKit/RecordOperation.swift`
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`

I'm prepared to help you with:
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code content with regex
- Reading and analyzing specific files
- Understanding the codebase structure
- Locating implementation details

What would you like me to search for or analyze in the MistKit codebase?

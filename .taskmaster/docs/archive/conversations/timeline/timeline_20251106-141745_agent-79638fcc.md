### 14:17:45 - USER
Explore the Bushel example codebase to understand its structure and identify the files mentioned in the code review:

1. Find and examine the main Bushel example directory structure
2. Locate these specific files mentioned in the review:
   - BushelCloudKitService.swift (error handling, private key handling)
   - RecordFieldConverter.swift (field type issues, type conversions)
   - RecordBuilder files (field mapping logic)
3. Check for existing test files related to Bushel
4. Examine the data fetcher implementations
5. Look for batch operation and deduplication logic

Provide a summary of:
- Directory structure of the Bushel example
- Key files and their purposes
- Current test coverage status
- Areas that need the most attention based on the review feedback

Be thorough in your exploration.

### 14:17:48 - ASSISTANT
I'll help you explore the Bushel example codebase to understand its structure and locate the files mentioned in the code review. Let me start with a comprehensive search.

### 14:17:48 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Find Bushel-related directories in proje]
[Glob: **/Bushel/**/*.swift]
[Glob: **/bushel/**/*.swift]

### 14:17:55 - ASSISTANT
Great! Now let me explore the directory structure and examine the key files:

### 14:17:55 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: List Bushel example directory contents]
[Bash: Find test files in Bushel example]
[Bash: Show Bushel sources tree structure]

### 14:18:09 - ASSISTANT
Excellent! Now let me examine the critical files mentioned in the review:

[Read: BushelCloudKitService.swift]
[Read: RecordBuilder.swift]
[Read: FieldValueExtensions.swift]
[Read: CloudKitFieldMapping.swift]

### 14:18:13 - ASSISTANT
Now let me look at the data source implementations and test coverage:

### 14:18:13 - ASSISTANT
[Read: DataSourcePipeline.swift]
[Read: SyncEngine.swift]
[Read: Package.swift]

### 14:18:20 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check for test files and examine the data source implementations:

### 14:18:20 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Find test files in Bushel project]
[Read: IPSWFetcher.swift]
[Read: MESUFetcher.swift]

### 14:18:29 - ASSISTANT
Let me check a couple more key data fetchers and look at the models:

### 14:18:29 - ASSISTANT
[Read: RestoreImageRecord.swift]
[Read: AppleDBFetcher.swift]
[Read: README.md]

### 14:18:34 - ASSISTANT
Let me check the implementation notes and look for any test structure:

### 14:18:34 - ASSISTANT
[Read: IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md]
[Bash: Check for test directories in Bushel]

### 14:18:39 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now let me check a few more key files to complete the picture:

### 14:18:39 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Count total Swift source files in Bushel]
[Read: XcodeVersionRecord.swift]
[Read: XcodeReleasesFetcher.swift]

### 14:19:06 - ASSISTANT
Excellent! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the Bushel example codebase. Let me create a detailed summary for you.

## Bushel Example Codebase Exploration Summary

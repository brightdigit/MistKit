I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search for code patterns, read file contents, and navigate the project structure.

Based on the project context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with:
- Main source code in `Sources/MistKit/`
- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`
- OpenAPI specification and generation scripts
- Documentation in `.claude/docs/`

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search through code, and analyze the project structure.

Based on the context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with:
- Main source code in `Sources/MistKit/`
- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`
- OpenAPI specification in `openapi.yaml`
- Generated code that goes in `Sources/MistKit/Generated/` (not committed)

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

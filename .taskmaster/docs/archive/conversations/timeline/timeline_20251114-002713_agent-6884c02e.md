I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist, equipped to:

- Use **Glob** patterns for broad file matching
- Use **Grep** with regex for content searching
- **Read** specific files you identify
- Run **Bash** commands for file operations

I have context about the MistKit project:
- It's a Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services
- Current branch: `feature/server-generated-record-names`
- Modified file: `Sources/MistKit/RecordOperation.swift`
- Recent work on server-side record name generation

I understand the project structure, development guidelines, and task management approach outlined in CLAUDE.md and Task Master configuration.

What would you like me to search for in the MistKit codebase?

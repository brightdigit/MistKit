### 18:59:13 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to help you with file search tasks in the MistKit project. I have access to the project context and understand the codebase structure.

Let me confirm my capabilities:

- **Glob pattern matching** - Finding files by pattern
- **Grep/regex searching** - Searching file contents
- **File reading** - Analyzing specific files
- **Bash operations** - Directory navigation and file operations

I also understand:
- This is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services
- The project uses modern Swift features (async/await, structured concurrency)
- Current branch is `blog-post-examples-doc-cleanup-WIP`
- Key directories: `Sources/MistKit/`, `Tests/MistKitTests/`, `Scripts/`, `Examples/`

I'm ready to help you search, navigate, and analyze the codebase. What would you like me to find?

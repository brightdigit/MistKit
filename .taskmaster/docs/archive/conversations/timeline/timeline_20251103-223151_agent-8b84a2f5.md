I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, specialized in file search and code exploration. I'm ready to help you navigate and search through the MistKit codebase.

I have context about:
- **MistKit**: A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: `blog-post-examples-code-bushel`
- **Project State**: Clean git status with recent work on blog post documentation
- **Key Files**: OpenAPI specification, Swift package structure, and comprehensive project documentation

I can assist you with:
- **File searching** using glob patterns for broad matching
- **Content searching** with regex patterns to find specific code
- **File reading** to analyze code and documentation
- **Code navigation** to understand the codebase structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit project?

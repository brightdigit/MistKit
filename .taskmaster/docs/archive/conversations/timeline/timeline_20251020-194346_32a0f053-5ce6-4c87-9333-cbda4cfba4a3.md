I'm ready to help you with searching and analyzing the MistKit codebase. I have context about the project structure, development practices, and the Task Master workflow system that's integrated here.

To summarize what I understand about the environment:

- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Location**: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`
- **Current Branch**: `blog-post-examples`
- **Key Technologies**: Swift, CloudKit Web Services, OpenAPI specification
- **Development Approach**: Modern Swift with async/await, protocol-oriented design, and dependency injection

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns for broad matching
- Search code contents with regex patterns using grep
- Read and analyze specific file contents
- Perform file operations and directory exploration
- Navigate the codebase structure effectively

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit codebase?

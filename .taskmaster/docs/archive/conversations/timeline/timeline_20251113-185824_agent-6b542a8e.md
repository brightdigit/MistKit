Warmup

### 18:58:28 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist with your codebase search and exploration needs. I have context about the MistKit project, a Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services, and I'm equipped with:

- **Glob patterns** for file matching
- **Grep/regex** for content searching
- **File reading** for detailed analysis
- **Bash operations** for exploration

The repository is on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch with a clean git status.

I understand the project structure:
- Swift package for CloudKit Web Services REST API access
- Modern async/await architecture with Swift Concurrency
- OpenAPI-driven development with swift-openapi-generator
- Comprehensive documentation in `.claude/docs/`
- Task Master integration for development workflow

I'm ready to help you search for files, explore code patterns, find specific implementations, or analyze the codebase structure. What would you like to find or explore?

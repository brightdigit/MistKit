I'm ready to assist you with searching and navigating the MistKit codebase. I have access to the project context and understand:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- Fresh rewrite using modern Swift features (async/await, actors, structured concurrency)
- Currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch
- Uses OpenAPI specification for CloudKit Web Services integration

**Available Tools:**
- Glob patterns for file discovery
- Grep with regex for content searching
- Read for specific file examination
- Bash for file operations

**Project Structure:**
- Sources/MistKit - Main package code
- Tests/MistKitTests - Test suite
- Examples/Celestra - Example implementations
- Scripts - Development utilities
- OpenAPI specifications and documentation

I'm ready to help you:
- Find files using patterns
- Search code by content or regex
- Read and analyze specific files
- Explore the codebase structure
- Provide absolute file paths in responses

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit codebase?

Let's order the todo items in @.claude/PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md 
Move Split each file by type and extension to the top followed by all other file and type length issues to the top

### 19:13:12 - ASSISTANT
I'll help you reorder the todo items in the PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md file to prioritize the file splitting and length issues at the top.

### 19:13:49 - ASSISTANT
Done! I've reordered the todo items in the PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md file to prioritize:

1. **File splitting by type and extension** - moved to the very top as the #1 critical item
2. **Large test file refactoring** - kept as the second critical item
3. **File length violations** - moved below the splitting tasks but still in the critical section

I also updated the priority summary at the bottom to reflect this new ordering, emphasizing file splitting first, then test file refactoring, then file length violations.

### 19:14:18 - USER
Let's remove refernces to test files for now from the critical errors since we are going to be migrating from XCTest to Swift Testing

### 19:14:20 - ASSISTANT
I'll remove the test file references from the critical errors section since you're migrating to Swift Testing.

[Request interrupted by user for tool use]

### 19:14:47 - USER
Just move them below the Swift Testing migration

### 19:15:37 - ASSISTANT
Done! I've moved the test file references from the critical errors section:

1. **Removed** "Split large test files into more focused test classes" from the critical errors section
2. **Moved** it below the Swift Testing migration item in the Test Framework Migration section
3. **Removed** the TokenManagerTests.swift file length violation from critical errors (since it will be handled during the Swift Testing migration)
4. **Updated** the priority summary to reflect 5 critical items instead of 7

Now the critical errors focus on the non-test file splitting and length violations, while test-related items are properly grouped under the Swift Testing migration section.

### 19:16:00 - USER
move Swift Testing migration above all other testing related suggestions

[TodoWrite: 1 items]

### 19:17:18 - ASSISTANT
Done! I've moved the Swift Testing migration section to the very top of the TEST COVERAGE IMPROVEMENTS section, making it the first priority before all other testing-related tasks. This ensures that the framework migration happens before any new test development work.

### 19:17:32 - USER
move all code comments and documentation items to the bottom

### 19:17:49 - ASSISTANT
Now I'll move the documentation section to the bottom, just before the final summary:

### 19:18:20 - ASSISTANT
Done! I've moved the entire **📚 DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS** section to the bottom of the todo list, placing it just before the final priority summary. This prioritizes:

1. Critical file splitting and length violations
2. High priority code issues (force unwraps, complexity, etc.)
3. Security improvements
4. Testing improvements
5. Performance optimizations
6. Architecture improvements
7. Platform configuration
8. Code style fixes
9. Specific issues
10. **Documentation improvements** (now at the bottom)

This ensures that functional code issues are addressed before documentation tasks.

### 19:20:40 - USER
After High Priority, put the security and PERFORMANCE and ARCHITECTURE improvements and SPECIFIC ISSUES FOUND next

### 19:20:45 - ASSISTANT
[TodoWrite: 1 items]

### 19:20:48 - ASSISTANT
I need to move the sections around. Let me first identify where the high priority section ends and then move the security, performance, architecture, and specific issues sections right after it.

### 19:20:48 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "## ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY WARNINGS" in PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]
[Grep: "## 📋 MEDIUM PRIORITY WARNINGS" in PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]

### 19:20:56 - ASSISTANT
Now let me find where each section currently starts to understand the structure:

### 19:20:56 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "^## 🛡️ SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS" in PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]
[Grep: "^## ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION" in PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]
[Grep: "^## 🔧 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT" in PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]
[Grep: "^## 🔍 SPECIFIC ISSUES FOUND" in PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]

### 19:21:07 - ASSISTANT
Now let me read the content to understand the boundaries and move these sections. I'll need to extract these sections and reinsert them after the high priority section:

### 19:21:07 - ASSISTANT
[Read: PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]

### 19:21:11 - ASSISTANT
I need to see the end of the SPECIFIC ISSUES section and where the next section starts:

### 19:21:11 - ASSISTANT
[Read: PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]

### 19:21:16 - ASSISTANT
Now I need to read where the HIGH PRIORITY section ends to know where to insert these sections:

### 19:21:16 - ASSISTANT
[Read: PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]

### 19:21:20 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! I can see that the HIGH PRIORITY section ends at line 45, and MEDIUM PRIORITY starts at line 46. I need to:

1. Extract the security, performance, architecture, and specific issues sections
2. Move them to be right after the HIGH PRIORITY section (before MEDIUM PRIORITY)
3. Remove them from their current locations

Let me start by removing these sections from their current locations and then insert them after HIGH PRIORITY:

### 19:21:20 - ASSISTANT
[Edit: PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]

### 19:21:53 - ASSISTANT
Now let me remove the SPECIFIC ISSUES section from its current location:

### 19:21:53 - ASSISTANT
[Edit: PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]

### 19:22:01 - ASSISTANT
Now I need to insert all four sections (Security, Performance, Architecture, and Specific Issues) after the HIGH PRIORITY section. Let me find the exact insertion point:

### 19:22:01 - ASSISTANT
[Edit: PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md]
[TodoWrite: 1 items]

### 19:22:41 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! I've successfully reordered the sections in the PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md file. The new order is now:

1. **🚨 CRITICAL ERRORS** (File splitting and length violations)
2. **⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY WARNINGS** (Force unwraps, complexity, etc.)
3. **🛡️ SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS** (Now moved up after high priority)
4. **⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS** (Now moved up after security)
5. **🔧 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS** (Now moved up after performance)
6. **🔍 SPECIFIC ISSUES FOUND** (Now moved up after architecture)
7. **📋 MEDIUM PRIORITY WARNINGS** (Access control, formatting, etc.)
8. **🔄 TYPE CONTENT ORDER VIOLATIONS**
9. **📈 TEST COVERAGE IMPROVEMENTS** (with Swift Testing migration at the top)
10. **🏗️ PLATFORM & CONFIGURATION**
11. **📝 CODE STYLE FIXES**
12. **📚 DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENTS** (moved to the bottom)

This prioritizes the most impactful technical improvements (security, performance, architecture, specific bugs) right after the high-priority warnings, while keeping documentation tasks at the end.

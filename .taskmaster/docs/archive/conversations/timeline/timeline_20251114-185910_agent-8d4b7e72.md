Warmup

### 18:59:15 - ASSISTANT
I'll help you search the MistKit codebase. I'm ready to assist with finding files, searching code contents, or exploring the project structure.

What would you like me to search for? For example:
- Find files matching a pattern
- Search for specific code or text
- Locate files related to a particular feature
- Explore a specific directory

Just let me know what you're looking for and I'll use the appropriate search tools (Glob for file patterns, Grep for code search, Read for specific files, or Bash for directory exploration).

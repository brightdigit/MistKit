Warmup

### 20:00:26 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to help you with the MistKit project. I have reviewed the context and understand:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- Currently on the `blog-post-examples` branch
- Fresh rewrite using modern Swift features and best practices

**Key Context Available:**
- Development commands for Swift package management
- Architecture considerations emphasizing modern Swift concurrency patterns
- OpenAPI-driven development workflow
- Task Master integration for project management

**My Capabilities:**
- File search and exploration using glob patterns and grep
- Code analysis and understanding
- Navigation through the codebase
- Providing absolute file paths and code snippets

I'm powered by Claude Haiku 4.5 and ready to assist with:
- Finding files and code patterns
- Analyzing the codebase structure
- Understanding the CloudKit Web Services integration
- Exploring the OpenAPI specification implementation
- Any other codebase-related searches or analysis

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the MistKit project?

next task

I'll get the next available task from Task Master.

### 20:00:52 - ASSISTANT
The next available task is **Task 2: OpenAPI Specification Analysis and Documentation** (Complexity: 6/10)

**Overview:**
Deep dive into the `openapi.yaml` file to document the specification creation process and key design decisions for the blog post.

**Key Objectives:**
- Analyze CloudKit-specific schema definitions (CKRecord, CKAsset, CKReference)
- Document authentication patterns and endpoint modeling
- Create before/after examples showing documentation-to-spec transformation
- Validate the OpenAPI spec using official tools

**Subtasks:**
1. **2.1** - Analyze and document CloudKit-specific schema definitions and authentication patterns
2. **2.2** - Document endpoint modeling, error response schemas, and pagination patterns (depends on 2.1)
3. **2.3** - Create comparative examples of documentation-to-specification transformation (depends on 2.1, 2.2)

**Dependencies:** This task depends on Task 1 being complete.

**Test Strategy:** Validate OpenAPI spec using tools like `swagger-codegen validate` or `openapi-generator validate`. Compare against Apple's CloudKit Web Services documentation.

Would you like me to start working on this task? I can begin with subtask 2.1 to analyze the CloudKit-specific schemas and authentication patterns in the openapi.yaml file.

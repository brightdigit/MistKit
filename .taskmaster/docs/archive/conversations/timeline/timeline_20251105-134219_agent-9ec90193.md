I'm Claude Code, ready to help you navigate and explore this codebase. I can see this is the MistKit-Bushel project, which appears to be working on CloudKit integration examples, specifically the Bushel demo.

From the git status, I can see you're on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch with several modified files and some new untracked directories related to Bushel and TheAppleWiki data source.

I have access to powerful search tools:
- **Glob** - Find files using patterns
- **Grep** - Search file contents with regex
- **Read** - Read specific files
- **Bash** - Execute file operations

How can I help you explore this codebase? Are you looking for specific files, code patterns, or would you like me to help understand the structure of the Bushel example?

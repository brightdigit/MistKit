I can:\n\n- **Search files** using glob patterns for broad matching\n- **Search content** with powerful regex patterns via grep\n- **Read files** when I know exact paths\n- **Explore structure** using bash commands\n\nI understand this is a Swift package project for CloudKit Web Services access, currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch with some recent changes to documentation and a Bushel demo.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

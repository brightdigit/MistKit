I have access to the project context and understand this is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services.\n\nI can help you with:\n\n- **File searching** using glob patterns and regex\n- **Code analysis** by reading and examining file contents\n- **Codebase navigation** to understand the project structure\n- **Research** within the MistKit project\n\nThe environment is set up at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit` on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch, and I'm aware of the project's architecture, development commands, and CloudKit Web Services integration details from the CLAUDE.md file.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit codebase?"

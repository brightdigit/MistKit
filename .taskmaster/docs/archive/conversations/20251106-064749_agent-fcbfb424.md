I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit-Bushel codebase.\n\nI can see you're working on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch of the MistKit project - a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services. The repository appears to be in a clean state with recent commits focused on Bushel improvements and CloudKit authentication.\n\nI'm equipped to:\n- Search files using glob patterns and regex\n- Read and analyze file contents\n- Navigate the Swift package structure\n- Reference the CloudKit Web Services OpenAPI specification\n- Help with Swift implementation following the project's modern concurrency patterns\n\nWhat would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase?"

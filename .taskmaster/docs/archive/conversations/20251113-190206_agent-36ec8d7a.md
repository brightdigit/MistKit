I have the project context loaded and understand the codebase structure.\n\nTo get started, I can help you:\n\n- Find files using glob patterns\n- Search code content with regex patterns\n- Read and analyze specific files\n- Navigate the Swift package structure\n- Explore the CloudKit Web Services integration\n\nThe repository is currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch, and I have access to important project documentation including CLAUDE.md with development guidelines, architecture considerations, and API references.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?"

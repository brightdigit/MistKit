Do we need both @.claude/docs/TESTING.md and @.claude/docs/testing-enablinganddisabling.md ?

    "type": "text",
    "text": "Looking at both files, we don't need both. Here's the breakdown:\n\n**`.claude/docs/TESTING.md`** - This is a custom guide specific to MistKit that explains:\n- How to test MistKit's authentication system\n- CloudKit container setup\n- CLI commands for the MistDemo\n- Authentication methods (API-only, web auth, adaptive tokens)\n\n**`.claude/docs/testing-enablinganddisabling.md`** - This is Apple's official documentation about Swift Testing framework features for enabling/disabling tests conditionally.\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep both files because they serve different purposes:\n\n1. `TESTING.md` - Essential for understanding how to test **this specific project**\n2. `testing-enablinganddisabling.md` - Reference documentation for Swift Testing framework features\n\nHowever, if you want to clean up, you could remove `testing-enablinganddisabling.md` since it's just copied Apple documentation that developers can reference online at https://developer.apple.com/documentation/testing/enablinganddisabling.\n\nThe project-specific `TESTING.md` is much more valuable for contributors to understand how to test MistKit's authentication flows."

testing-enablinganddisabling.md is for you claude

  {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "Ah, I see! The `testing-enablinganddisabling.md` file is reference documentation for me to understand Swift Testing framework features when working with your codebase.\n\nIn that case, **yes, keep both files**:\n\n- `TESTING.md` - For human developers working on MistKit\n- `testing-enablinganddisabling.md` - For me (Claude) to reference Swift Testing capabilities\n\nThis makes sense since Swift Testing is relatively new (Swift 6.0+/Xcode 16.0+) and having the reference documentation helps me provide better assistance with:\n- Using `.disabled()` and `.enabled(if:)` traits\n- Setting up conditional test execution\n- Understanding time limits with `.timeLimit()`\n- Working with test traits and annotations\n\nThe file provides good context for when I need to help with test organization and conditional test execution in your Swift package."

Is there a better place to store it? Should it be added to @CLAUDE.md ?

    "type": "text",
    "text": "Looking at your `CLAUDE.md` file, I think there are two good options:\n\n**Option 1: Keep it separate** (recommended)\n- The current location `/.claude/docs/testing-enablinganddisabling.md` is appropriate\n- It's reference documentation that I can access when needed\n- Keeps the main `CLAUDE.md` focused on project-specific guidance\n\n**Option 2: Add a reference in CLAUDE.md**\nYou could add a brief mention in the \"Testing Strategy\" section of `CLAUDE.md`:\n\n```markdown\n### Testing Strategy\n- Unit tests for all public APIs\n- Integration tests using mock URLSession\n- Use Swift Testing framework with conditional test execution (see .claude/docs/testing-enablinganddisabling.md for trait reference)\n- Async test support with `async let` and `await`\n```\n\n**My recommendation**: Keep it where it is. The `/.claude/docs/` directory is a good pattern for storing reference documentation that's specifically for me to use when working on the project. It's discoverable but doesn't clutter the main project guidance file.\n\nThe current organization is clean:\n- `CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific instructions and architecture\n- `.claude/docs/TESTING.md` - How to test MistKit (for humans)\n- `.claude/docs/testing-enablinganddisabling.md` - Swift Testing reference (for Claude)"

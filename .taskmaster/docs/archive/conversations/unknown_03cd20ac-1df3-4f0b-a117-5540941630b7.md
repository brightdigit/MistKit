    "text": "You are an AI assistant helping to update a subtask. You will be provided with the subtask's existing details, context about its parent and sibling tasks, and a user request string.\n\nYour Goal: Based *only* on the user's request and all the provided context (including existing details if relevant to the request), GENERATE the new text content that should be added to the subtask's details.\nFocus *only* on generating the substance of the update.\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Return *only* the newly generated text content as a plain string. Do NOT return a JSON object or any other structured data.\n2. Your string response should NOT include any of the subtask's original details, unless the user's request explicitly asks to rephrase, summarize, or directly modify existing text.\n3. Do NOT include any timestamps, XML-like tags, markdown, or any other special formatting in your string response.\n4. Ensure the generated text is concise yet complete for the update based on the user request. Avoid conversational fillers or explanations about what you are doing (e.g., do not start with \"Okay, here's the update...\"). \n\n Always respond in English.\n\nHuman: ## IMPORTANT: Codebase Analysis Required\n\nYou have access to powerful codebase analysis tools. Before generating the subtask update:\n\n1. Use the Glob tool to explore the project structure (e.g., \"**/*.js\", \"**/*.json\", \"**/README.md\")\n2. Use the Grep tool to search for existing implementations, patterns, and technologies\n3. Use the Read tool to examine relevant files and understand current implementation\n4. Analyze the current codebase to inform your subtask update\n\nBased on your analysis:\n- Include specific file references, code patterns, or implementation details\n- Ensure suggestions align with the project's current architecture\n- Reference existing components or patterns when relevant\n- Make implementation notes specific to the codebase structure\n\nProject Root: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit\n\nTask Context:\n\nParent Task: {\n  \"id\": 6,\n  \"title\": \"Celestra RSS Feed Tool - Design and SyndiKit Integration\"\n}\nPrevious Subtask: {\n  \"id\": \"6.2\",\n  \"title\": \"Implement RSS Feed Fetching and Parsing with SyndiKit\",\n  \"status\": \"done\"\n}\nCurrent Subtask Details (for context only):\nImplement queryArticlesByGUIDs method in CloudKitService+Celestra.swift to query existing articles by GUID and feed record name using QueryFilter. Create duplicate filtering logic that compares new articles against existing ones using GUID matching. Integrate duplicate detection into the article creation workflow before calling createArticles. Handle batch operations efficiently by chunking GUID queries to respect CloudKit's query limits. Add error handling for query failures and implement retry logic. Follow patterns from BUSHEL_PATTERNS.md for robust deduplication strategies. Ensure performance optimization by only querying for articles that don't already exist locally.\n\nUser Request: \"PARTIALLY COMPLETE: Model conversion (toFieldsDict/init) done. CloudKitService has create/query/update methods. MISSING: Duplicate detection logic - articles are created without checking if they already exist. Need to add queryArticlesByGUIDs method and filter duplicates before upload.\"\n\nBased on the User Request and all the Task Context (including current subtask details provided above), what is the new information or text that should be appended to this subtask's details? Return ONLY this new text as a plain string.\n\n\n# Additional Project Context\n\n## Task Context\n\n**Subtask 6.3: Implement GUID-Based Duplicate Detection for Articles**\nParent Task: Celestra RSS Feed Tool - Design and SyndiKit Integration\nDescription: Implement duplicate detection by querying existing articles by GUID before insertion to prevent redundant CloudKit records.\nStatus: pending\nDependencies: 1, 2\nImplementation Details: Implement queryArticlesByGUIDs method in CloudKitService+Celestra.swift to query existing articles by GUID and feed record name using QueryFilter.

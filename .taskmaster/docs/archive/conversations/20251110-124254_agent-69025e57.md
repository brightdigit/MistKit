I can help you find files, search for specific code patterns, or explore the structure of this CloudKit Web Services Swift package.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for? Some examples of what I can do:\n\n- Find files by pattern (e.g., \"Find all Swift files related to authentication\")\n- Search for specific code (e.g., \"Find where async/await is used\")\n- Locate configuration files (e.g., \"Find OpenAPI configuration\")\n- Explore test files (e.g., \"Find all test files\")\n\nJust let me know what you're looking for!"

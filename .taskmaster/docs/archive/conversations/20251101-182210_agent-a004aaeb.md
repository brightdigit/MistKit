I can help you find files, search through code, and analyze the contents of this Swift package for CloudKit Web Services.\n\nBased on the environment information, I can see:\n- Working directory: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`\n- This is a git repository on the `blog-post-examples` branch\n- There are some uncommitted changes to the blog post template and FieldValue.swift\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

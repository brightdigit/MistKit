For example:\n- Find files matching a pattern\n- Search for specific code or text\n- Locate files related to a particular feature\n- Explore a specific directory\n\nJust let me know what you're looking for and I'll use the appropriate search tools (Glob for file patterns, Grep for code search, Read for specific files, or Bash for directory exploration)."

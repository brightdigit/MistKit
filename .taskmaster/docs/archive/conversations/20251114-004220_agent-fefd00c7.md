I'm ready to help you search through and analyze your MistKit codebase.\n\nI can see you're working on the **refactor/to-initializer-pattern** branch with recent commits focused on refactoring to initializer patterns and standardizing error handling.\n\nHere's what I can do for you:\n\n- **File Search**: Use glob patterns to find files across your codebase\n- **Content Search**: Use regex patterns to search within file contents\n- **File Reading**: Examine specific files in detail\n- **Code Analysis**: Help you understand code structure and relationships\n\nI also have access to your project context:\n- **MistKit** is a Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services\n- You're using modern Swift features (async/await, actors, protocols)\n- The project follows a structure with Sources, Tests, and Scripts directories\n- You have comprehensive documentation in CLAUDE.md about architecture, testing, and logging\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or analyze in your MistKit codebase?"

    "text": "I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase. I can help you find files, search for code patterns, or analyze specific parts of the project.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for? For example, I can:\n- Find files matching specific patterns (e.g., \"all Swift test files\")\n- Search for specific code or text within files (e.g., \"CloudKit authentication implementations\")\n- Locate and read specific files you need to review\n- Explore directory structures\n\nWhat search task would you like me to help with?"

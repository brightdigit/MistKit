I can help you find files, search through code, read specific files, and explore the repository structure.\n\nBased on the environment information, I can see you're working in the MistKit project on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch with a clean git status.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

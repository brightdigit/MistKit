    "text": "I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search code contents, and explore the project structure.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for? For example, I can:\n- Find files matching specific patterns (e.g., \"Find all Swift test files\")\n- Search for code containing specific text or patterns (e.g., \"Find usages of async/await\")\n- Locate specific files or directories\n- Explore the project structure\n\nWhat's your search request?"

I think the section on authentication types is slightly incorrect theres only 2 webauthtoken and server-to-server. API Token is only the first step before using the webauthtoken.

Each section has questions to guide you, word count targets, and placeholders for your responses.\n     4→\n     5→---\n     6→\n     7→## PART 1: Introduction - The Decision to Rebuild (650 words)\n     8→\n     9→### Opening Paragraph: SyntaxKit Transition (~150 words)\n    10→\n    11→**Prompt**: Write the opening that connects SyntaxKit to MistKit\n    12→\n    13→**Questions to answer**:\n    14→1. What was the key lesson from building SyntaxKit? (the pattern/philosophy)\n    15→2. When did you look at MistKit v0.2 and realize it needed a rebuild?\n    16→3. What made you confident you could do it after SyntaxKit?\n    17→\n    18→**Write here**:\n    19→```\n    20→[Your opening paragraph - start with \"In my previous article about Building SyntaxKit with AI...\"]\n    21→\n    22→It had been more than 5 years since I looked at MistKit, my swift package for doing CloudKit on the server. I no longer had a reason to use the product since Sign In With Apple would suffice. However, I did have a couple use cases where it would handy and it's very reasonable pricing would make it an interesting prospect.\n    23→\n    24→In my previous article, I talked about building SyntaxKit using Cursor and Claude Code based on Apple's documentation, exploring the AST of code examples, and more. In the article, I am going to explain a different tact. \n    25→\n    26→With the creation of the Swift openapi generator, we have a great tool already available to us for generating API from openapi documentation. In this article, I'm going to talk about my approach to create my own openapi document based on the CloudKit documentation, overcoming pitfalls, creating an abstraction layer and my goals for this project.\n    27→\n    28→Through building SyntaxKit, I discovered a sustainable pattern: Me + Claude Code + Code Generation working in harmony. It was time to apply this three-way collaboration to MistKit.\n    29→```\n    30→\n    31→---\n    32→\n    33→### Section 1.1: State of MistKit v0.2 (~150 words)\n    34→\n    35→Originally developed as an easy way to link Apple Watches to account in Heartwitch, I hadn't touched MistKit in over 5 years and a lot has changed:\n    36→\n    37→* **Sign In With Apple** offers a simpler way to login from the Apple Watch while not having to maintain 2 databases. Going forward this is the way I would develop authentication on a full stack swift application.\n    38→\n    39→* **OpenAPI Generator** - in 2020 I had to develop my own abstraction for Vapor vs Async Client vs URLSession. Along with the code generation, this would great simplify my codebase.\n    40→\n    41→* **Swift 6** - in 2020 there were still plenty of completion handlers. With async-await I can create something that's both much cleaner and safer.\n    42→\n    43→On top of these major advances, it was much too difficult in my limited time to continue adding features to the library. However with the advent of LLMs I was offered an opportunity to think differently.\n    44→\n    45→---\n    46→\n    47→### Section 1.2: Need for Change (~100 words)\n    48→\n    49→Just as with SyntaxKit, I can take an indirect approach to rebuilding MistKit with these new technologies. Rather then building the Swift API directly, we create an openapi document which the code generator can use to generate the CloudKit API for me.\n    50→\n    51→OpenAPI is a specification for documenting HTTP services—essentially a YAML file that defines every endpoint, request/response schema, and error case for an API. Apple's swift-openapi-generator reads this document and generates type-safe Swift code at build time: a `Client` type with methods for each operation, Codable structs for all models, and automatic encoding/decoding. Instead of maintaining thousands of lines of networking boilerplate, you maintain one OpenAPI document, and the generator keeps your code in sync whenever the spec changes.\n    52→\n    53→This worked for the most part except for 2 challenging pieces: dynamic data types and authentication.\n    54→\n    55→---\n    56→\n    57→\n    58→\n    59→\n    60→\n    61→```\n    62→\n    63→---\n    64→\n    65→### Section 1.4: The Bold Decision (~200 words)\n    66→\n    67→**Prompt**: Describe the three-way collaboration vision\n    68→\n    69→**Questions to answer**:\n    70→1. What role would OpenAPI play?\n    71→We would create a openapi.yml for the CloudKit Rest API. Swift OpenAPI Generator would generate the code to communicate with it.\n    72→2. What role would Claude Code play?\n    73→Claude Code would parse Apple's documentation and iteratively build the openapi.yml.\n    74→3. What role would you play?\n    75→>I would provide requirements and guidance on how I want MistKit to work.\n    76→4. What was the timeline?\n    77→> No timeline\n    78→5. What was the result?\n    79→\n    80→> We've been able to successfully write and read record type of all kinds right now.\n    81→\n    82→**The Vision - A Three-Way Collaboration**:\n    83→\n    84→1. **OpenAPI specification**:\n    85→The OpenAPI spec would serve as the foundation, defining all 17 CloudKit Web Services endpoints across six categories (records, zones, subscriptions, users, assets, tokens). The Swift OpenAPI Generator would then transform this single YAML file into over 20,000 lines of type-safe Swift code—complete request/response models, HTTP client logic, and automatic encoding/decoding. Any API changes would simply require updating the spec and regenerating.\n    86→\n    87→2. **Claude Code**:\n    88→Claude would handle the translation of Apple's prose documentation into structured OpenAPI YAML, maintaining consistency across hundreds of schemas. It would also generate comprehensive test suites, draft the abstraction layer code, and assist with refactoring when architectural decisions changed.\n    89→\n    90→3. **Human architecture** (you):\n    91→I would provide the architectural vision—the three-layer design, protocol-oriented patterns, and security constraints. I have a better understanding of what a developer would want to do and what is required for a modern Swift library. LLMs can be dated pretty quickly and I have a good understanding of the openapi generator as well as CloudKit. So I spot a misunderstanding and an outdated implementation of an API easily. My domain expertise in CloudKit's quirks (like ASSETID vs ASSET) would guide the implementation decisions.\n    92→\n    93→\n    94→**Timeline**: July 2025 - Present (~4 months, ongoing development)\n    95→\n    96→**The Result**:\n    97→- ✅ **17 CloudKit endpoints** fully specified in OpenAPI specification\n    98→- ✅ **20,952 lines** of auto-generated, type-safe Swift code from the spec\n    99→- ✅ **157 test methods** across 66 test files covering authentication, middleware, field types, and error handling\n   100→- ✅ **45 hand-written Swift files** in the abstraction layer\n   101→- ✅ **Core features working**: Query/modify records, list zones, fetch user info, all 3 authentication methods (API Token, Server-to-Server, Web Auth)\n   102→\n   103→\n   104→\n   105→\n   106→```\n   107→\n   108→---\n   109→\n   110→## PART 2: Translating CloudKit Docs to OpenAPI with Claude Code (900 words)\n   111→\n   112→### Section 2.1: Why OpenAPI? (~150 words)\n   113→\n   114→**Already exists in draft - CONDENSE**\n   115→\n   116→From current draft lines 77-131 (currently ~250 words, condense to 150)\n   117→\n   118→**Questions to guide condensing**:\n   119→- What is OpenAPI in one sentence?\n   120→- What was the \"aha moment\"? \n   121→> First being to pull results from both the private and the public database.\n   122→- What are the 3-4 key benefits?\n   123→\n   124→**Action**: ✅ Edit existing content to be more concise\n   125→\n   126→---\n   127→\n   128→### Section 2.2: The Translation Challenge (~150 words) **NEW**\n   129→\n   130→**Prompt**: Describe why translating CloudKit docs to OpenAPI was challenging\n   131→\n   132→**Questions to answer**:\n   133→1. What format are Apple's CloudKit docs in? (prose, not machine-readable)\n   134→> prose\n   135→2. What needed to be translated? (endpoints, types, errors into structured YAML)\n   136→Yes all of these things needed to be translated correctly.\n   137→3. Why was this perfect for Claude Code collaboration?\n   138→It is really good at reading documentation, requirements, or descriptions of any kind and translating them to code.\n   139→4. What was your role vs Claude's role?\n   140→Claude's role was to translate the documentation into yaml. My role was to guide Claude with my experience working with the CloudKit Rest API.\n   141→\n   142→**Write here**:\n   143→```\n   144→**The Human Problem**:\n   145→\n   146→Apple's CloudKit documentation exists in two main forms—both written for human readers, not machines. The web services documentation describes endpoints and structures in prose, while the CloudKit JS documentation provides additional structural details. Neither is machine-readable or structured enough to directly generate code from.\n   147→\n   148→I needed to convert these narrative documents into an easy-to-use format (markdown) that Claude Code could process. Using https://llm.codes, I transformed both documentation sources into markdown that preserved the technical details while being digestible for AI analysis.\n   149→\n   150→\n   151→**Why This Was Perfect for Claude Code**:\n   152→\n   153→This translation task played directly to Claude's strengths. Pattern recognition allowed it to identify consistent structures across Apple's documentation—similar endpoint patterns, repeating field types, common error responses. Consistency checking meant Claude could maintain uniformity across the large YAML specification with hundreds of schemas, catching discrepancies I might miss. Most importantly, iteration speed was phenomenal—when I spotted a CloudKit quirk or API edge case, Claude could refine the spec in minutes rather than the hours manual editing would require.\n   154→\n   155→\n   156→**The Workflow That Emerged**:\n   157→\n   158→1. **I provide**: Markdown-converted Apple documentation for a specific endpoint or feature\n   159→2. **Claude drafts**: Initial OpenAPI YAML with endpoints, schemas, and types\n   160→3. **I review**: Check for CloudKit-specific quirks and architectural fit\n   161→4. **Claude updates**: Refine based on my domain expertise feedback\n   162→5. **Iterate**: Continue until the endpoint is complete and validated\n   163→\n   164→\n   165→\n   166→```\n   167→\n   168→---\n   169→\n   170→### Section 2.3: Field Value - The Dynamic Typing Challenge (~250 words) **MAJOR**\n   171→\n   172→**Prompt**: Tell the story of solving the Field Value polymorphism problem WITH Claude\n   173→\n   174→**Questions to answer**:\n   175→1. What was the problem? (CloudKit fields are dynamically typed, OpenAPI is static)\n   176→✅ **ANSWERED**: CloudKit uses dynamic typing like GraphQL - a single field can be string, int, double, location, reference, asset, etc. OpenAPI requires static types known at compile time.\n   177→\n   178→2. What did you tell Claude initially?\n   179→✅ **ANSWERED**: \"Here's the CloudKit field value structure from Apple's docs. Each field has a 'value' that can be any of a dozen different types, plus a 'type' string indicating which one it is.\"\n   180→\n   181→3. What did Claude suggest first? (probably `oneOf` pattern)\n   182→✅ **ANSWERED**: Yes, Claude suggested using OpenAPI's `oneOf` pattern to model the polymorphic values.\n   183→\n   184→4. What CloudKit quirk did you identify? (ASSETID vs ASSET)\n   185→✅ **ANSWERED**: ASSET is used for uploads (contains fileChecksum, size, receipt, wrappingKey), while ASSETID is used for downloads (contains downloadURL). Both use the same AssetValue structure but different type identifiers.\n   186→\n   187→5. What did Claude suggest for that?\n   188→✅ **ANSWERED**: Claude suggested handling both ASSET and ASSETID types by decoding them to the same AssetValue type using a decoder dictionary pattern.\n   189→\n   190→6. How did you arrive at the final CustomFieldValue design?\n   191→✅ **ANSWERED**: Used a decoder dictionary with closures instead of switch statements, created a type override in the OpenAPI generator config, and implemented a two-layer design: public `FieldValue` enum for the API, internal `CustomFieldValue` struct for wire format.\n   192→\n   193→**Write here**:\n   194→```\n   195→**The Core Problem**:\n   196→\n   197→CloudKit fields are dynamically typed—a single field can hold strings, numbers, locations, references, or assets. Just like GraphQL, CloudKit uses runtime type information to determine what each field contains. However, OpenAPI and Swift's type system expect static types known at compile time.\n   198→\n   199→CloudKit's JSON structure looks like this:\n   200→{\n   201→  \"name\": {\"value\": \"John\", \"type\": \"STRING\"},\n   202→  \"age\": {\"value\": 42, \"type\": \"INT64\"},\n   203→  \"photo\": {\"value\": {...}, \"type\": \"ASSET\"}\n   204→}\n   205→\n   206→The challenge: How do you model this polymorphism in OpenAPI's static schema system?\n   207→\n   208→\n   209→\n   210→\n   211→**The Claude Code Conversation**:\n   212→\n   213→Me: \"Here's the CloudKit field value structure from Apple's docs. Each field has a 'value' that can be any of a dozen different types, plus a 'type' string indicating which one it is.\"\n   214→\n   215→Claude: \"I can model this using OpenAPI's `oneOf` pattern. Let me draft a schema:\"\n   216→\n   217→```yaml\n   218→FieldValue:\n   219→  type: object\n   220→  properties:\n   221→    value:\n   222→      oneOf:\n   223→        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/StringValue'\n   224→        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Int64Value'\n   225→        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/AssetValue'\n   226→        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/ReferenceValue'\n   227→        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/LocationValue'\n   228→        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/ListValue'\n   229→    type:\n   230→      type: string\n   231→      enum: [STRING, INT64, DOUBLE, BYTES, REFERENCE, ASSET, ASSETID, LOCATION, TIMESTAMP, LIST]\n   232→```\n   233→\n   234→Me: \"Wait—there are TWO asset types: ASSET and ASSETID. What's the difference, and how should we handle them?\"\n   235→\n   236→Claude: \"Looking at Apple's documentation, ASSET is used when uploading (contains fileChecksum, size, receipt, wrappingKey), while ASSETID is used when reading (contains downloadURL). They use the same structure but different type identifiers depending on context. Both should decode to AssetValue.\"\n   237→\n   238→Me: \"Good catch. Now we need a custom implementation because the generated code won't handle this nuance automatically. Can you create a CustomFieldValue type?\"\n   239→\n   240→Claude: \"Here's a design using a decoder dictionary pattern:\n   241→\n   242→```swift\n   243→internal struct CustomFieldValue: Codable, Sendable {\n   244→    internal enum FieldTypePayload: String, Codable {\n   245→        case asset = \"ASSET\"\n   246→        case assetid = \"ASSETID\"\n   247→        // ... other types\n   248→    }\n   249→\n   250→    private static let fieldTypeDecoders: [FieldTypePayload: (Container) throws -> CustomFieldValuePayload] = [\n   251→        .asset: { .assetValue(try $0.decode(AssetValue.self, forKey: .value)) },\n   252→        .assetid: { .assetValue(try $0.decode(AssetValue.self, forKey: .value)) },\n   253→        // ... other decoders\n   254→    ]\n   255→\n   256→    internal let value: CustomFieldValuePayload\n   257→    internal let type: FieldTypePayload?\n   258→}\n   259→```\n   260→\n   261→This uses a dictionary of closures instead of a massive switch statement, making it easier to maintain.\"\n   262→\n   263→Me: \"Perfect.

Add timeline: \"How long vs solo estimate?\" - estimate based on experience\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Actions Needed\n\n### Critical Fixes:\n1. ✅ **Fix date error**: Line 94 says \"July 2025\" should be \"July 2024\"\n\n### Content to Add:\n2. ⚠️ **Section 2.1**: Copy and condense draft lines 77-131 (~250 words → 150 words)\n3. ⚠️ **Section 2.4**: Add \"Claude's Contribution\" subsection (may need user input)\n4. ⚠️ **Section 2.5**: Expand partial answers into full paragraphs and add `/records/query` example\n\n### Already Complete (No Action):\n- ✅ Section 1.0: Opening paragraph\n- ✅ Section 1.1: State of MistKit v0.2\n- ✅ Section 1.2: Need for Change\n- ✅ Section 1.4: The Bold Decision (except date fix)\n- ✅ Section 2.2: The Translation Challenge\n- ✅ Section 2.3: Field Value challenge\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Content Mapping\n\n### Section 2.1: Content to Copy and Condense\n\n**From draft lines 77-131**, extract and condense:\n\n**Key points to preserve**:\n```\n- OpenAPI definition (line 82-90)\n- The \"aha moment\" (lines 129-131)\n- Benefits checklist (lines 137-143):\n  ✅ Type safety\n  ✅ Completeness\n  ✅ Maintainability\n  ✅ Accuracy\n  ✅ No manual JSON\n```\n\n**Target condensed version (~150 words)**:\n- 1 sentence: What is OpenAPI\n- 2-3 sentences: The aha moment\n- 4-5 sentences: Benefits\n\n---\n\n### Section 2.4: Claude's Contribution (Missing Details)\n\n**From draft lines 265-295**, the content explains the technical implementation but doesn't explicitly call out \"what Claude suggested.\"\n\n**Possible inference from context**:\n- Claude likely suggested using OpenAPI's `securitySchemes` to model both methods\n- Claude probably helped identify that some endpoints need different auth\n- Claude may have suggested the middleware pattern\n\n**Recommendation**: Ask user: \"What specifically did Claude suggest about the authentication security schemes? The draft doesn't explicitly mention Claude's role in the auth design.\"\n\n---\n\n### Section 2.5: Example Needed\n\n**Template asks for**: \"Walk through a specific example\" of `/records/query` endpoint\n\n**Draft content**: Lines 397-451 have the OpenAPI spec for `/records/query`\n\n**Suggested example structure**:\n1. I draft: \"I told Claude we need to support the query endpoint with filters\"\n2. Claude expands: \"Claude generated the initial OpenAPI schema with Query, Filter, and Sort types\"\n3. I review: \"I noticed the resultsLimit had no bounds\"\n4. Claude validates: \"Claude added minimum: 1, maximum: 200 constraints\"\n5. Iterate: \"After 3 rounds, the endpoint was complete\"\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to proceed with creating the filled-in content for sections 2.1, 2.4, and 2.5, or do you need to provide additional context about Claude's specific contributions to the authentication design?"

I think the iteration part is slightly off. We'd iterate on each endpoint to make sure it works - correct spec, unit test, real world test with command line tool. At the time of this post, the library is incomplete and has not covered all end points.

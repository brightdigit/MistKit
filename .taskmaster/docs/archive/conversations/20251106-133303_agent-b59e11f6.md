    "text": "I'm ready to help you search and explore the MistKit-Bushel codebase! I can help you find files, search code content, and navigate the project structure.\n\nBased on the context, I can see this is a Swift package project that provides CloudKit Web Services access. The project uses:\n- Swift Package Manager\n- OpenAPI code generation\n- Modern Swift concurrency (async/await)\n- Task Master AI for project management\n\nWhat would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase?"

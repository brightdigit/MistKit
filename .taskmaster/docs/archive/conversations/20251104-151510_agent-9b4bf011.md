    "text": "I'm ready to help you search and explore the MistKit-Celestra codebase. I can assist with:\n\n- **Finding files** using glob patterns\n- **Searching code** with regex patterns (grep)\n- **Reading file contents** when you know the specific path\n- **Running bash commands** for file operations\n\nBased on the context, I can see this is a Swift package project for CloudKit Web Services integration, currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase?"

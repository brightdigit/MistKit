    "text": "I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search through code, and explore the project structure.\n\nBased on the context, I can see that MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services. The project uses:\n- Swift with modern async/await patterns\n- OpenAPI-based code generation\n- Swift Testing framework\n- Task Master for project management\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

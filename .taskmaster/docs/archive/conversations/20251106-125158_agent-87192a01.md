    "text": "I'll help you search the MistKit codebase. I'm ready to use file search tools like Glob, Grep, and Read to navigate and explore the code.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for? For example, I can:\n- Find files matching specific patterns (e.g., \"all Swift test files\")\n- Search for specific code patterns or text (e.g., \"CloudKit authentication logic\")\n- Locate and read specific files (e.g., \"show me the main client file\")\n- Explore directory structures and dependencies\n\nPlease let me know what you're looking for in the codebase."

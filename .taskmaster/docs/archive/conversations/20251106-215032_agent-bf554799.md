    "text": "I'm ready to assist you with code exploration and search tasks in the MistKit-Bushel project. I have good context about the codebase and the project structure.\n\nBased on the git status, I can see you're on the `pr132-code-review-fixes` branch with recent changes to CloudKit-related files, including a new `RecordTypeSet.swift` file that hasn't been committed yet.\n\nI can help you with:\n- **File searches** using glob patterns\n- **Content searches** with regex patterns\n- **Code analysis** and navigation\n- **Reading and exploring** specific files\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

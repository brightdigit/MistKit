    "text": "You are an AI assistant helping to update a subtask. You will be provided with the subtask's existing details, context about its parent and sibling tasks, and a user request string.\n\nYour Goal: Based *only* on the user's request and all the provided context (including existing details if relevant to the request), GENERATE the new text content that should be added to the subtask's details.\nFocus *only* on generating the substance of the update.\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. Return *only* the newly generated text content as a plain string. Do NOT return a JSON object or any other structured data.\n2. Your string response should NOT include any of the subtask's original details, unless the user's request explicitly asks to rephrase, summarize, or directly modify existing text.\n3. Do NOT include any timestamps, XML-like tags, markdown, or any other special formatting in your string response.\n4. Ensure the generated text is concise yet complete for the update based on the user request. Avoid conversational fillers or explanations about what you are doing (e.g., do not start with \"Okay, here's the update...\"). \n\n Always respond in English.\n\nHuman: ## IMPORTANT: Codebase Analysis Required\n\nYou have access to powerful codebase analysis tools. Before generating the subtask update:\n\n1. Use the Glob tool to explore the project structure (e.g., \"**/*.js\", \"**/*.json\", \"**/README.md\")\n2. Use the Grep tool to search for existing implementations, patterns, and technologies\n3. Use the Read tool to examine relevant files and understand current implementation\n4. Analyze the current codebase to inform your subtask update\n\nBased on your analysis:\n- Include specific file references, code patterns, or implementation details\n- Ensure suggestions align with the project's current architecture\n- Reference existing components or patterns when relevant\n- Make implementation notes specific to the codebase structure\n\nProject Root: /Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit\n\nTask Context:\n\nParent Task: {\n  \"id\": 3,\n  \"title\": \"Generated Code Analysis and swift-openapi-generator Integration\"\n}\nNext Subtask: {\n  \"id\": \"3.2\",\n  \"title\": \"Analyze and Document Generated Swift Code Structure with Examples\",\n  \"status\": \"pending\"\n}\nCurrent Subtask Details (for context only):\nExamine the openapi-generator-config.yaml file in detail. Document installation process for swift-openapi-generator version 1.0+. Explain each configuration option and its impact on generated code. Include command-line examples for running the generator. Document integration with build systems (SPM, Xcode). Create a troubleshooting section for common configuration issues. Ensure documentation covers Swift 5.9+ specific features and configuration options.\n\nUser Request: \"Completed comprehensive documentation for swift-openapi-generator setup and configuration.\n\nCreated: Sources/MistKit/Documentation.docc/OpenAPICodeGeneration.md (492 lines)\n\nDocumentation includes:\n- Overview of why code generation is used and benefits\n- Architecture diagram showing generation flow\n- Complete installation and setup instructions for Mint and swift-openapi-generator\n- Detailed explanation of all configuration options in openapi-generator-config.yaml\n- Package.swift integration details and rationale for NOT using build plugin\n- Swift settings and language features explanation\n- Complete breakdown of Scripts/generate-openapi.sh script\n- Generated code structure analysis (Client.swift and Types.swift)\n- Integration points with MistKit wrapper layer\n- Troubleshooting guide for common issues\n- Best practices for version control and when to regenerate\n\nAlso updated Documentation.md to include reference to the new article in Topics section.\"\n\nBased on the User Request and all the Task Context (including current subtask details provided above), what is the new information or text that should be appended to this subtask's details? Return ONLY this new text as a plain string.\n\n\n# Additional Project Context\n\n## Task Context\n\n**Subtask 3.1: Document swift-openapi-generator Setup and Configuration Process**\nParent Task: Generated Code Analysis and swift-openapi-generator Integration\nDescription: Create comprehensive documentation for setting up and configuring swift-openapi-generator with the project\nStatus: in-progress\nImplementation Details: Examine the openapi-generator-config.yaml file in detail. Document installation process for swift-openapi-generator version 1.0+. Explain each configuration option and its impact on generated code. Include command-line examples for running the generator. Document integration with build systems (SPM, Xcode). Create a troubleshooting section for common configuration issues. Ensure documentation covers Swift 5.9+ specific features and configuration options.\n\n---\n\n**Task 3: Generated Code Analysis and swift-openapi-generator Integration**\nDescription: Document the code generation process and analyze the output of swift-openapi-generator\nStatus: in-progress\nPriority: medium\nDependencies: 2\nImplementation Details: Examine `openapi-generator-config.yaml` configuration and document the swift-openapi-generator setup process. Analyze generated Swift code structure including: API client interfaces, request/response models, error types, and type-safe builders. Document the Swift Package Manager integration and build process. Show examples of generated code with annotations explaining type safety benefits. Use swift-openapi-generator version 1.0+ with proper configuration for Swift 5.9+ features. Document the...\nTest Strategy: Verify generated code compiles successfully with latest Swift toolchain. Test that configuration produces expected output structure. Validate that generated types match OpenAPI schema definitions.\nSubtasks: 3 subtasks defined\n\n---\n\n**Task 1: Historical Analysis and Development Journey Documentation**\nDescription: Analyze conversation history and extract the complete development story of MistKit's rewrite journey\nStatus: done\nPriority: high\nImplementation Details: Review all files in `.claude/conversations/` directory to extract key decisions, milestones, challenges, and solutions. Map the evolution from old MistKit to OpenAPI-driven approach. Document the 'why' behind major architectural decisions. Create a timeline of development phases and extract quotes/insights for the blog narrative. Use tools like `grep`, `awk`, and manual analysis to identify patterns in decision-making. Structure findings into narrative arcs for blog sections. Focus on extract...\nTest Strategy: Verify completeness by cross-referencing extracted decisions with actual code changes in git history. Validate timeline accuracy against commit dates. Ensure all major architectural decisions are captured with proper context.\nSubtasks: 4 subtasks defined\n\n---\n\n**Task 10: Blog Post Integration, Examples, and Final Polish**\nDescription: Complete the blog post with working examples, lessons learned, and comprehensive review\nStatus: pending\nPriority: high\nDependencies: 8, 9\nImplementation Details: Integrate command-line tool examples with complete source code and usage instructions. Write sections on: development journey insights, lessons learned and challenges, AWS Lambda conversion overview, architecture decisions, and future roadmap. Add comprehensive code comparisons showing generated vs. abstraction layer transformations. Include table of contents, proper cross-references, and links to GitHub repositories. Perform technical accuracy review ensuring all code compiles with latest Sw...\nTest Strategy: Compile and test all included code examples in fresh environments. Verify all links and references work correctly. Test blog post readability and technical accuracy through peer review.

Document how Apple's REST API documentation was translated into OpenAPI 3.0.3 format. Extract key sections for blog examples showing before/after of documentation-to-spec transformation. Use OpenAPI validation tools like `swagger-codegen validate` or `openapi-generator...\nTest Strategy: Validate OpenAPI spec using official validation tools.

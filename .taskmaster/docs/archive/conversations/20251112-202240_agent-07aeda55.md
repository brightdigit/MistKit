    "text": "I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search for specific code patterns, read file contents, and navigate the project structure.\n\nBased on the context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services that recently migrated from OSLog to swift-log. The project has:\n\n- Main source code in `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/Sources/MistKit/`\n- Test files in `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/Tests/`\n- OpenAPI specifications and documentation\n- Task Master integration for project management\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or help you find in the codebase?"

    "text": "I'm ready to help you search and explore the MistKit codebase! I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services access, currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch.\n\nFrom the context, I understand:\n- This is a modern Swift rewrite on the `claude` branch (though git shows we're on `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`)\n- The project provides server-side and CLI access to CloudKit Web Services\n- It uses OpenAPI specifications for code generation\n- Recent commits show work on Celestra documentation and CloudKit schema management\n\nWhat would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase? I can:\n- Search for specific files, functions, or code patterns\n- Explore the project structure and organization\n- Find examples of particular implementations\n- Locate documentation or configuration files\n- Analyze code relationships and dependencies\n\nJust let me know what you're looking for!"

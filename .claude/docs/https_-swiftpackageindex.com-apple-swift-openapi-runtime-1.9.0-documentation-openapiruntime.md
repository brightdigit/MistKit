Framework

# OpenAPIRuntime

Use and extend your client and server code generated by Swift OpenAPI Generator.

## Overview

This library provides common abstractions and helper functions used by the client and server code generated by Swift OpenAPI Generator.

It contains:

- Common types used in the code generated by the `swift-openapi-generator` package plugin.

- Protocol definitions for pluggable layers, including `ClientTransport`, `ServerTransport`, `ClientMiddleware`, and `ServerMiddleware`.

Many of the HTTP currency types used are defined in the Swift HTTP Types library.

### Usage

Add the package dependency in your `Package.swift`:

.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime", from: "1.0.0"),

Next, in your target, add `OpenAPIRuntime` to your dependencies:

.target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [\
.product(name: "OpenAPIRuntime", package: "swift-openapi-runtime"),\
]),

The next step depends on your use case.

#### Using Swift OpenAPI Generator for code generation

The generated code depends on types from this library. Check out the adoption guides in the Swift OpenAPI Generator documentation to see how the packages fit together.

#### Implementing transports and middlewares

Swift OpenAPI Generator generates client and server code that is designed to be used with pluggable transports and middlewares.

Implement a new transport or middleware by providing a type that adopts one of the protocols from the runtime library:

- `ClientTransport`

- `ClientMiddleware`

- `ServerTransport`

- `ServerMiddleware`

You can also publish your transport or middleware as a Swift package to allow others to use it with their generated code.

Protocol

# ClientTransport

A type that performs HTTP operations.

protocol ClientTransport : Sendable

ClientTransport.swift

## Overview

Decouples an underlying HTTP library from generated client code.

### Choose between a transport and a middleware

The `ClientTransport` and `ClientMiddleware` protocols look similar, however each serves a different purpose.

A _transport_ abstracts over the underlying HTTP library that actually performs the HTTP operation by using the network. A generated `Client` requires an exactly one client transport.

A _middleware_ intercepts the HTTP request and response, without being responsible for performing the HTTP operation itself. That’s why middlewares take the extra `next` parameter, to delegate making the HTTP call to the transport at the top of the middleware stack.

### Use an existing client transport

Instantiate the transport using the parameters required by the specific implementation. For example, using the client transport for the `URLSession` HTTP client provided by the Foundation framework:

let transport = URLSessionTransport()

Instantiate the `Client` type generated by the Swift OpenAPI Generator for your provided OpenAPI document. For example:

let client = Client(
serverURL: URL(string: "https://example.com")!,
transport: transport
)

Use the client to make HTTP calls defined in your OpenAPI document. For example, if the OpenAPI document contains an HTTP operation with the identifier `checkHealth`, call it from Swift with:

let response = try await client.checkHealth()

The generated operation method takes an `Input` type unique to the operation, and returns an `Output` type unique to the operation.

### Implement a custom client transport

If a client transport implementation for your preferred HTTP library doesn’t yet exist, or you need to simulate rare network conditions in your tests, consider implementing a custom client transport.

For example, to implement a test client transport that allows you to test both a healthy and unhealthy response from a `checkHealth` operation, define a new struct that conforms to the `ClientTransport` protocol:

struct TestTransport: ClientTransport {
var isHealthy: Bool = true
func send(
_ request: HTTPRequest,
body: HTTPBody?,
baseURL: URL,
operationID: String

(
HTTPResponse(status: isHealthy ? .ok : .internalServerError),
nil
)
}
}

Then in your test code, instantiate and provide the test transport to your generated client instead:

var transport = TestTransport()
transport.isHealthy = true // for HTTP status code 200 (success)
let client = Client(
serverURL: URL(string: "https://example.com")!,
transport: transport
)
let response = try await client.checkHealth()

Implementing a test client transport is just one way to help test your code that integrates with a generated client. Another is to implement a type conforming to the generated protocol `APIProtocol`, and to implement a custom `ClientMiddleware`.

Protocol

# ServerTransport

A type that registers and handles HTTP operations.

protocol ServerTransport

ServerTransport.swift

## Overview

Decouples the HTTP server framework from the generated server code.

### Choose between a transport and a middleware

The `ServerTransport` and `ServerMiddleware` protocols look similar, however each serves a different purpose.

A _transport_ abstracts over the underlying HTTP library that actually receives the HTTP requests from the network. An implemented _handler_ (a type implemented by you that conforms to the generated `APIProtocol` protocol) is generally configured with exactly one server transport.

A _middleware_ intercepts the HTTP request and response, without being responsible for receiving the HTTP operations itself. That’s why middlewares take the extra `next` parameter, to delegate calling the handler to the transport at the top of the middleware stack.

### Use an existing server transport

Instantiate the transport using the parameters required by the specific implementation. For example, using the server transport for the `Vapor` web framework, first create the `Application` object provided by Vapor, and provided it to the initializer of `VaporTransport`:

let app = Vapor.Application()
let transport = VaporTransport(routesBuilder: app)

Implement a new type that conforms to the generated `APIProtocol`, which serves as the request handler of your server’s business logic. For example, this is what a simple implementation of a server that has a single HTTP operation called `checkHealth` defined in the OpenAPI document, and it always returns the 200 HTTP status code:

struct MyAPIImplementation: APIProtocol {
func checkHealth(
_ input: Operations.checkHealth.Input

.ok(.init())
}
}

The generated operation method takes an `Input` type unique to the operation, and returns an `Output` type unique to the operation.

Create an instance of your handler:

let handler = MyAPIImplementation()

Create the URL where the server will run. The path of the URL is extracted by the transport to create a common prefix (such as `/api/v1`) that might be expected by the clients.

Register the generated request handlers by calling the method generated on the `APIProtocol` protocol:

try handler.registerHandlers(
on: transport,
serverURL: URL(string: "/api/v1")!
)

Start the server by following the documentation of your chosen transport:

try await app.execute()

### Implement a custom server transport

If a server transport implementation for your preferred web framework doesn’t yet exist, or you need to simulate rare network conditions in your tests, consider implementing a custom server transport.

Define a new type that conforms to the `ServerTransport` protocol by registering request handlers with the underlying web framework, to be later called when the web framework receives an HTTP request to one of the HTTP routes.

In tests, this might require using the web framework’s specific test APIs to allow for simulating incoming HTTP requests.

Implementing a test server transport is just one way to help test your code that integrates with your handler. Another is to implement a type conforming to the generated protocol `APIProtocol`, and to implement a custom `ServerMiddleware`.

Protocol

# ClientMiddleware

A type that intercepts HTTP requests and responses.

protocol ClientMiddleware : Sendable

ClientTransport.swift

## Overview

It allows you to read and modify the request before it is received by the transport and the response after it is returned by the transport.

Appropriate for handling authentication, logging, metrics, tracing, injecting custom headers such as “user-agent”, and more.

### Choose between a transport and a middleware

The `ClientTransport` and `ClientMiddleware` protocols look similar, however each serves a different purpose.

A _transport_ abstracts over the underlying HTTP library that actually performs the HTTP operation by using the network. A generated `Client` requires an exactly one client transport.

A _middleware_ intercepts the HTTP request and response, without being responsible for performing the HTTP operation itself. That’s why middlewares take the extra `next` parameter, to delegate making the HTTP call to the transport at the top of the middleware stack.

### Use an existing client middleware

Instantiate the middleware using the parameters required by the specific implementation. For example, using a hypothetical existing middleware that logs every request and response:

let loggingMiddleware = LoggingMiddleware()

Similarly to the process of using an existing `ClientTransport`, provide the middleware to the initializer of the generated `Client` type:

let client = Client(
serverURL: URL(string: "https://example.com")!,
transport: transport,
middlewares: [\
loggingMiddleware,\
]
)

Then make a call to one of the generated client methods:

let response = try await client.checkHealth()

As part of the invocation of `checkHealth`, the client first invokes the middlewares in the order you provided them, and then passes the request to the transport. When a response is received, the last middleware handles it first, in the reverse order of the `middlewares` array.

### Implement a custom client middleware

If a client middleware implementation with your desired behavior doesn’t yet exist, or you need to simulate rare network conditions your tests, consider implementing a custom client middleware.

For example, to implement a middleware that injects the “Authorization” header to every outgoing request, define a new struct that conforms to the `ClientMiddleware` protocol:

/// Injects an authorization header to every request.
struct AuthenticationMiddleware: ClientMiddleware {

/// The token value.
var bearerToken: String

func intercept(
_ request: HTTPRequest,
body: HTTPBody?,
baseURL: URL,
operationID: String,

var request = request
request.headerFields[.authorization] = "Bearer \(bearerToken)"
return try await next(request, body, baseURL)
}
}

An alternative use case for a middleware is to inject random failures when calling a real server, to test your retry and error-handling logic.

Implementing a test client middleware is just one way to help test your code that integrates with a generated client. Another is to implement a type conforming to the generated protocol `APIProtocol`, and to implement a custom `ClientTransport`.

# ServerMiddleware

A type that intercepts HTTP requests and responses.

protocol ServerMiddleware : Sendable

ServerTransport.swift

## Overview

It allows you to customize the request after it was provided by the transport, but before it was parsed, validated, and provided to the request handler; and the response after it was provided by the request handler, but before it was handed

The `ServerTransport` and `ServerMiddleware` protocols look similar, however each serves a different purpose.

A _transport_ abstracts over the underlying HTTP library that actually receives the HTTP requests from the network. An implemented _handler_ (a type implemented by you that conforms to the generated `APIProtocol` protocol) is generally configured with exactly one server transport.

A _middleware_ intercepts the HTTP request and response, without being responsible for receiving the HTTP operations itself. That’s why middlewares take the extra `next` parameter, to delegate calling the handler to the transport at the top of the middleware stack.

### Use an existing server middleware

Instantiate the middleware using the parameters required by the specific implementation. For example, using a hypothetical existing middleware that logs every request and response:

let loggingMiddleware = LoggingMiddleware()

Similarly to the process of using an existing `ServerTransport`, provide the middleware to the call to register handlers:

try handler.registerHandlers(
on: transport,
serverURL: URL(string: "/api/v1")!,
middlewares: [\
loggingMiddleware,\
]
)

Then when an HTTP request is received, the server first invokes the middlewares in the order you provided them, and then passes the parsed request to your handler. When a response is received from the handler, the last middleware handles the response first, and it goes back in the reverse order of the `middlewares` array. At the end, the transport sends the final response

If a server middleware implementation with your desired behavior doesn’t yet exist, or you need to simulate rare requests in your tests, consider implementing a custom server middleware.

For example, an implementation a middleware that prints only basic information about the incoming request and outgoing response:

/// A middleware that prints request and response metadata.
struct PrintingMiddleware: ServerMiddleware {
func intercept(
_ request: HTTPRequest,
body: HTTPBody?,
metadata: ServerRequestMetadata,
operationID: String,

print(">>>: \(request.method.rawValue) \(request.soar_pathOnly)")
do {
let (response, responseBody) = try await next(request, body, metadata)
print("<<<: \(response.status.code)")
return (response, responseBody)
} catch {
print("!!!: \(error)")
throw error
}
}
}

Implementing a test server middleware is just one way to help test your code that integrates with your handler. Another is to implement a type conforming to the generated protocol `APIProtocol`, and to implement a custom `ServerTransport`.

Class

# HTTPBody

A body of an HTTP request or HTTP response.

final class HTTPBody

HTTPBody.swift

## Overview

Under the hood, it represents an async sequence of byte chunks.

## Creating a body from a buffer

Create an empty body:

let body = HTTPBody()

Create a body from a byte chunk:

let body = HTTPBody(bytes)

Create a body from `Foundation.Data`:

let data: Foundation.Data = ...
let body = HTTPBody(data)

Create a body from a string:

let body = HTTPBody("Hello, world!")

## Creating a body from an async sequence

The body type also supports initialization from an async sequence.

let producingSequence = ... // an AsyncSequence
let length: HTTPBody.Length = .known(1024) // or .unknown
let body = HTTPBody(
producingSequence,
length: length,
iterationBehavior: .single // or .multiple
)

In addition to the async sequence, also provide the total body length, if known (this can be sent in the `content-length` header), and whether the sequence is safe to be iterated multiple times, or can only be iterated once.

Sequences that can be iterated multiple times work better when an HTTP request needs to be retried, or if a redirect is encountered.

In addition to providing the async sequence, you can also produce the body using an `AsyncStream` or `AsyncThrowingStream`:

let body = HTTPBody(

continuation.yield([72, 69])
continuation.yield([76, 76, 79])
continuation.finish()
}),
length: .known(5)
)

## Consuming a body as an async sequence

For example, to get another sequence that contains only the size of each chunk, and print each size, use:

let chunkSizes = body.map { chunk in chunk.count }
for try await chunkSize in chunkSizes {
print("Chunk size: \(chunkSize)")
}

## Consuming a body as a buffer

If you need to collect the whole body before processing it, use one of the convenience initializers on the target types that take an `HTTPBody`.

let buffer = try await ArraySlice(collecting: body, upTo: 2 * 1024 * 1024)

The body type provides more variants of the collecting initializer on commonly used buffers, such as:

- `Foundation.Data`

- `Swift.String`

# Base64EncodedData

A type for converting data as a base64 string.

struct Base64EncodedData

Base64EncodedData.swift

## Overview

This type holds raw, unencoded, data as a slice of bytes. It can be used to encode that data to a provided `Encoder` as base64-encoded data or to decode from base64 encoding when initialized from a decoder.

There is a convenience initializer to create an instance backed by provided data in the form of a slice of bytes:

let base64EncodedData = Base64EncodedData(data: bytes)

To decode base64-encoded data it is possible to call the initializer directly, providing a decoder:

let base64EncodedData = Base64EncodedData(from: decoder)

However more commonly the decoding initializer would be called by a decoder, for example:

let encodedData: Data = ...
let decoded = try JSONDecoder().decode(Base64EncodedData.self, from: encodedData)

Once an instance is holding data, it may be base64 encoded to a provided encoder:

let base64EncodedData = Base64EncodedData(data: bytes)
base64EncodedData.encode(to: encoder)

However more commonly it would be called by an encoder, for example:

let encodedData = JSONEncoder().encode(encodedBytes)

Class

# MultipartBody

The body of multipart requests and responses.

MultipartPublicTypes.swift

## Overview

`MultipartBody` represents an async sequence of multipart parts of a specific type.

The `Part` generic type parameter is usually a generated enum representing the different values documented for this multipart body.

## Creating a body from buffered parts

Create a body from an array of values of type `Part`:

.myCaseA(...),\
.myCaseB(...),\
]

## Creating a body from an async sequence of parts

The body type also supports initialization from an async sequence.

let producingSequence = ... // an AsyncSequence of MyPartType
let body = MultipartBody(
producingSequence,
iterationBehavior: .single // or .multiple
)

In addition to the async sequence, also specify whether the sequence is safe to be iterated multiple times, or can only be iterated once.

Sequences that can be iterated multiple times work better when an HTTP request needs to be retried, or if a redirect is encountered.

In addition to providing the async sequence, you can also produce the body using an `AsyncStream` or `AsyncThrowingStream`:

let (stream, continuation) = AsyncStream.makeStream(of: MyPartType.self)
// Pass the continuation to another task that produces the parts asynchronously.
Task {
continuation.yield(.myCaseA(...))
// ... later
continuation.yield(.myCaseB(...))
continuation.finish()
}
let body = MultipartBody(stream)

## Consuming a body as an async sequence

The `MultipartBody` type conforms to `AsyncSequence` and uses a generic element type, so it can be consumed in a streaming fashion, without ever buffering the whole body in your process.

for try await part in multipartBody {
switch part {
case .myCaseA(let myCaseAValue):
// Handle myCaseAValue.
case .myCaseB(let myCaseBValue):
// Handle myCaseBValue, which is a raw type with a streaming part body.
//
// Option 1: Process the part body bytes in chunks.
for try await bodyChunk in myCaseBValue.body {
// Handle bodyChunk.
}
// Option 2: Accumulate the body into a byte array.
// (For other convenience initializers, check out ``HTTPBody``.
let fullPartBody = try await UInt8
// ...
}
}

Multipart parts of different names can arrive in any order, and the order is not significant.

Consuming the multipart body should be resilient to parts of different names being reordered.

However, multiple parts of the same name, if allowed by the OpenAPI document by defining it as an array, should be treated as an ordered array of values, and those cannot be reordered without changing the message’s meaning.

## Overview

Contains an untyped JSON value. In some cases, the structure of the data may not be known in advance and must be dynamically iterated at decoding time. This is an advanced feature that requires extra validation of the input before use, and is at a higher risk of a security vulnerability.

Supported nested Swift types:

- `nil`

- `String`

- `Int`

- `Double`

- `Bool`

- `[Any?]`

- `[String: Any?]`

Where the element type of the array, and the value type of the dictionary must also be supported types.

## Topics

### Operators

Compares two `OpenAPIValueContainer` instances for equality.

### Initializers

`init(from: any Decoder) throws`

Initializes an `OpenAPIValueContainer` by decoding it from a decoder.

`init(unvalidatedValue: (any Sendable)?) throws`

Creates a new container with the given unvalidated value.

### Instance Properties

`var value: (any Sendable)?`

The underlying dynamic value.

### Instance Methods

`func encode(to: any Encoder) throws`

Encodes the `OpenAPIValueContainer` and writes it to an encoder.

# OpenAPIObjectContainer

A container for a dictionary with values represented by JSON Schema.

struct OpenAPIObjectContainer

OpenAPIValue.swift

## Overview

Contains a dictionary of untyped JSON values. In some cases, the structure of the data may not be known in advance and must be dynamically iterated at decoding time. This is an advanced feature that requires extra validation of the input before use, and is at a higher risk of a security vulnerability.

Supported nested Swift types:

- `nil`

- `String`

- `Int`

- `Double`

- `Bool`

- `[Any?]`

- `[String: Any?]`

Where the element type of the array, and the value type of the dictionary must also be supported types.

## Topics

### Initializers

`init()`

Creates a new empty container.

`init(from: any Decoder) throws`

[`init(unvalidatedValue: [String : (any Sendable)?]) throws`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime/1.9.0/documentation/openapiruntime/openapiobjectcontainer/init(unvalidatedvalue:))

Creates a new container with the given unvalidated value.

### Instance Properties

[`var value: [String : (any Sendable)?]`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-runtime/1.9.0/documentation/openapiruntime/openapiobjectcontainer/value)

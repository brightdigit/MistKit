    "text": "I'm ready to help you with your search needs in the MistKit-Predicates codebase. I've reviewed the context about this Swift package for CloudKit Web Services and understand the project structure, development commands, and architectural approach.\n\nThe project is a fresh rewrite using modern Swift features (async/await, structured concurrency, actors) with an OpenAPI-driven development approach. I'm familiar with:\n\n- The package structure and file organization\n- Development workflows and Swift commands\n- Architecture principles (protocol-oriented, dependency injection, error handling)\n- Testing strategy using Swift Testing framework\n- CloudKit Web Services integration patterns\n- Task Master integration for development workflow\n\nI'm equipped to:\n- Use glob patterns to find files\n- Search code and text with regex\n- Read and analyze file contents\n- Provide absolute file paths in results\n- Navigate the codebase efficiently\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit-Predicates codebase?"

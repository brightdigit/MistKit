I'm ready to assist with finding files, searching code contents, or reading specific files. \n\nBased on the context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services access, currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch with a clean git status.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

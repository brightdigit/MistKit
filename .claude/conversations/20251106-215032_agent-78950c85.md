    "text": "I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit-Bushel codebase! I can see this is a CloudKit Web Services project with some recent changes on the `pr132-code-review-fixes` branch.\n\nFrom the git status, I can see:\n- Modified files in the Bushel example project (Package.swift, BushelCloudKitService.swift, etc.)\n- A new untracked file: RecordTypeSet.swift\n- Recent commits focused on Phase 5 documentation and refactoring to protocol-oriented design\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

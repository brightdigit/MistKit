    "text": "I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit-Bushel codebase. I can help you:\n\n- Find files using glob patterns\n- Search code contents with regex patterns\n- Read and analyze specific files\n- Navigate the project structure\n\nI can see this is a Swift project for CloudKit Web Services, with a Bushel demo example. The repository is on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

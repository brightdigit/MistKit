I can see you're working on a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with some recent linting updates.\n\nFrom the git status, I can see there's a modified file:\n- `Sources/MistKit/Extensions/RecordManaging+RecordCollection.swift`\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?"

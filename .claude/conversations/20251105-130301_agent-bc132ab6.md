    "text": "I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search for specific code patterns, or explore the project structure.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for? Some examples of what I can do:\n\n- Find specific files (e.g., \"Find all Swift files related to CloudKit authentication\")\n- Search for code patterns (e.g., \"Find all async functions that use URLSession\")\n- Locate test files (e.g., \"Show me all test files for the networking layer\")\n- Explore directory structure (e.g., \"What files are in the Examples directory?\")\n\nJust let me know what you're looking for and I'll help you navigate the codebase efficiently!"

I can help you find files, search code contents, and read specific files using glob patterns, regex searches, and direct file reads.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for? For example:\n- Find specific files by pattern\n- Search for code containing certain text or patterns\n- Read and analyze particular files\n- Locate implementations of specific functionality\n\nLet me know what you're looking for and I'll navigate the codebase efficiently to find it."

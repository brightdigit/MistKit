I'm not sure so much about Section 3.2 in @.taskmaster/docs/blog-post-writing-template.md

    "text": "I can see your concern about Section 3.2. Let me read the current state of that section and understand what's troubling you.\n\nLooking at Section 3.2 (lines 399-488), I can see it's asking you to fill in a lot of details about the authentication challenge, but the prompts are quite open-ended with placeholders like:\n\n- \"swift-openapi-generator expects: [What?]\"\n- \"But CloudKit has: [Two methods - describe each briefly]\"\n- \"Our First Attempt (didn't work): [What did you try? Show the YAML?]\"\n- etc.\n\n**What specifically concerns you about this section?** Is it:\n\n1. **You don't remember the details** of what you tried first or how you solved it?\n2. **The authentication middleware pattern** - you're not sure it's complex/interesting enough to warrant 300 words?\n3. **The structure feels forced** - too many sub-prompts making it feel like a fill-in-the-blank exercise?\n4. **Technical accuracy** - you're not confident about the details of the swift-openapi-generator's authentication assumptions?\n5. **Something else entirely**?\n\nLet me know what's bothering you about it, and I can help either:\n- Simplify/restructure the section\n- Help you recall the technical details by exploring the codebase\n- Suggest a different angle or emphasis\n- Remove/consolidate it if it's not actually that important to the story\n\nWhat's your main concern?"

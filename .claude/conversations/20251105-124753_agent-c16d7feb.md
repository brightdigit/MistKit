I can help you find files, search for code patterns, read file contents, and navigate the project structure.\n\nBased on the project context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with:\n- Main source code in `Sources/MistKit/`\n- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`\n- OpenAPI specification and generation scripts\n- Documentation in `.claude/docs/`\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?"

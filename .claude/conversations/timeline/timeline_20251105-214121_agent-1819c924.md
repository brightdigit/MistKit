I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit-Bushel codebase! I can help you find files, search code contents, and navigate the project structure efficiently.

Some things I can help with:
- Finding specific files using glob patterns
- Searching for code patterns with regex
- Locating implementations of specific features
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Exploring the project structure

What would you like to search for in the codebase?

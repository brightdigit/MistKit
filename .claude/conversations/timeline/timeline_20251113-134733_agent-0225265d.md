I'm ready to assist with your search needs for the MistKit project. I have a good understanding of the codebase context:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift package for server-side and command-line access to CloudKit Web Services
- Current branch: `blog-post-examples-code-celestra`
- Main branch for PRs: `main`
- Platform: macOS (darwin)

**Key Resources Available:**
- Full CLAUDE.md instructions for development guidelines
- OpenAPI spec for CloudKit Web Services
- Reference documentation in `.claude/docs/`
- Task Master integration for workflow management
- Swift Testing framework for tests

**My Capabilities:**
- Finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code with regex patterns
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Navigating the codebase thoroughly

I'm ready to help you search for files, understand code structure, find specific implementations, or explore any part of the MistKit codebase. What would you like me to search for or investigate?

I'm Claude Code, ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit codebase. I can help you find files, search through code, and analyze the project structure.

I understand this is the Celestra example project within MistKit - a CloudKit Web Services Swift package. The project is on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch and has a clean git status.

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase?

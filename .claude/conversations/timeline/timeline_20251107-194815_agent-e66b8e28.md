I'm ready to help you with file searching and navigation in your MistKit-Lint-Upgrade project. I can see you're working on a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services with some recent linting updates.

From the git status, I can see there's a modified file:
- `Sources/MistKit/Extensions/RecordManaging+RecordCollection.swift`

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?

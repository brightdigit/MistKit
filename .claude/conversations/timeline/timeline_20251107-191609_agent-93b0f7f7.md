I'm ready to help you work with the MistKit-Lint-Upgrade project. I have access to:

1. **Project Context**: MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
2. **Current Status**: Clean working directory on the `MistKit-Lint-Upgrade` branch
3. **Key Files**: 
   - CLAUDE.md with project guidelines
   - Task Master integration for organized development
   - OpenAPI specification for CloudKit Web Services

I can help you with:
- Searching and navigating the codebase
- Finding specific files using glob patterns and grep
- Reading and analyzing code
- Understanding the project structure
- Running Swift commands (build, test, etc.)
- Working with the Task Master system

What would you like me to help you with for the MistKit project?

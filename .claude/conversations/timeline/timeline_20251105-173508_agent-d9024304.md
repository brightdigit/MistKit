I'm ready to assist you with code search and exploration in the MistKit-Bushel repository. I understand the project context:

**Project Summary:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for server-side CloudKit Web Services access
- Currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch
- Uses modern Swift features (async/await, structured concurrency, actors)
- OpenAPI spec-driven development with swift-openapi-generator
- Includes Task Master integration for development workflow

**My capabilities for this session:**
- Efficiently search files using glob patterns
- Search code content with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific file contents
- Navigate the codebase structure
- Return absolute file paths in responses

**Key project files I'm aware of:**
- `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit-Bushel/CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions
- `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit-Bushel/.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md` - Task Master integration
- OpenAPI specifications for CloudKit Web Services
- Swift source code in `Sources/MistKit/`
- Tests in `Tests/MistKitTests/`

I'm ready to help you search for files, analyze code, or explore any aspect of the codebase. What would you like to find or investigate?

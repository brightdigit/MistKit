I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search for specific code patterns, or explore the project structure.

What would you like me to search for? Some examples of what I can do:

- Find specific files (e.g., "Find all Swift files related to CloudKit authentication")
- Search for code patterns (e.g., "Find all async functions that use URLSession")
- Locate test files (e.g., "Show me all test files for the networking layer")
- Explore directory structure (e.g., "What files are in the Examples directory?")

Just let me know what you're looking for and I'll help you navigate the codebase efficiently!

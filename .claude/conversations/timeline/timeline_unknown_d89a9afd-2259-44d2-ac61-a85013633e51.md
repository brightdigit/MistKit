I don't think @TESTING.md is in a appropiate location.

### 21:47:34 - ASSISTANT
You're right. Where would you like me to move `TESTING.md`? 

Looking at the project structure, `.taskmaster/docs/` seems like the appropriate documentation directory.

### 21:47:55 - USER
how about @.claude/docs ?

### 21:47:58 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check if .claude directory exists]
[Bash: Create .claude/docs directory]
[Bash: Move TESTING.md to .claude/docs director]

### 21:48:05 - ASSISTANT
Moved `TESTING.md` to `.claude/docs/TESTING.md`.

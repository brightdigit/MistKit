I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, specialized in file search and codebase navigation. I'm ready to help you explore and understand the MistKit-Lint-Upgrade project.

I've reviewed the project context:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services access
- Currently on the `MistKit-Lint-Upgrade` branch
- One modified file: `Sources/MistKit/Extensions/RecordManaging+RecordCollection.swift`

**Available Context:**
- Comprehensive CLAUDE.md with project architecture and development commands
- Task Master integration for workflow management
- Swift testing and code generation patterns
- OpenAPI specification for CloudKit Web Services

**My Capabilities:**
- Search files using glob patterns for broad matching
- Search code content with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific file contents
- Navigate the codebase efficiently
- Provide absolute file paths in all responses

I'm ready to help you with code searches, file exploration, or any questions about the MistKit codebase. What would you like me to search for or investigate?

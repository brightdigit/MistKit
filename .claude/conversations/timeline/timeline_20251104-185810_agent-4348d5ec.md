I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit codebase efficiently.

I have context about:
- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Environment**: macOS (Darwin 25.1.0)
- **Untracked Files**: Examples/Celestra/ and Sources/MistKit/Service/CloudKitService+RecordModification.swift

I'm equipped to:
- Use glob patterns for broad file matching
- Search code with regex patterns via grep
- Read specific files
- Execute bash commands for file operations
- Return absolute file paths
- Adapt search strategies based on your needs

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit codebase?

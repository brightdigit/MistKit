I'm Claude Code's file search specialist, ready to help you navigate the MistKit codebase efficiently. I can help you find files, search through code, read specific files, and explore the repository structure.

Based on the environment information, I can see you're working in the MistKit project on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch with a clean git status.

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

### 19:56:52 - ASSISTANT
I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI assistant for the MistKit project. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore this codebase.

I have context about:
- **MistKit**: A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: `blog-post-examples` (with `main` as the primary branch)
- **Project Location**: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`
- **Development Tools**: Swift package management, OpenAPI code generation, Task Master integration
- **Architecture**: Modern Swift with async/await, structured concurrency, and protocol-oriented design

I'm ready to help you with:
- Finding files using glob patterns and grep searches
- Reading and analyzing code files
- Exploring the project structure
- Understanding the CloudKit Web Services integration
- Reviewing Swift implementation patterns
- Navigating the OpenAPI specification

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the MistKit codebase?

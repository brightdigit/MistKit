Warmup

### 22:14:03 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with your MistKit project! I have a good understanding of the codebase context:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- Currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch
- Uses modern Swift features (async/await, actors, structured concurrency)
- Built with OpenAPI code generation from `openapi.yaml`

**Key Technical Details:**
- Target: Cross-platform Swift (Linux, server-side, CLI)
- Architecture: Protocol-oriented with dependency injection
- Testing: Swift Testing framework with `@Test` macros
- Documentation: Available in `.claude/docs/` with guides on CloudKit, testing, and code generation

**Available Tools:**
- File search via glob patterns and regex grep
- Code reading and analysis
- Bash for file operations

I'm prepared to:
1. Search through the codebase efficiently
2. Analyze code structure and implementation
3. Help with CloudKit API integration
4. Assist with Swift concurrency patterns
5. Support testing and code generation workflows

What would you like me to help you with? Feel free to ask me to search for files, analyze code, explore the codebase structure, or assist with any development tasks.

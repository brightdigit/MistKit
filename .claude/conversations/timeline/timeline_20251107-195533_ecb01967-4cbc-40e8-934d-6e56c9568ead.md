### 19:55:33 - USER
You are an AI assistant helping to update a subtask. You will be provided with the subtask's existing details, context about its parent and sibling tasks, and a user request string.

Your Goal: Based *only* on the user's request and all the provided context (including existing details if relevant to the request), GENERATE the new text content that should be added to the subtask's details.
Focus *only* on generating the substance of the update.

Output Requirements:
1. Return *only* the newly generated text content as a plain string. Do NOT return a JSON object or any other structured data.
2. Your string response should NOT include any of the subtask's original details, unless the user's request explicitly asks to rephrase, summarize, or directly modify existing text.
3. Do NOT include any timestamps, XML-like tags, markdown, or any other special formatting in your string response.
4. Ensure the generated text is concise yet complete for the update based on the user request. Avoid conversational fillers or explanations about what you are doing (e.g., do not start with "Okay, here's the update..."). 

 Always respond in English.

Human: ## IMPORTANT: Codebase Analysis Required

You have access to powerful codebase analysis tools. Before generating the subtask update:

1. Use the Glob tool to explore the project structure (e.g., "**/*.js", "**/*.json", "**/README.md")
2. Use the Grep tool to search for existing implementations, patterns, and technologies
3. Use the Read tool to examine relevant files and understand current implementation
4. Analyze the current codebase to inform your subtask update

Based on your analysis:
- Include specific file references, code patterns, or implementation details
- Ensure suggestions align with the project's current architecture
- Reference existing components or patterns when relevant
- Make implementation notes specific to the codebase structure

### 19:55:36 - ASSISTANT
I need to analyze the codebase to understand the current implementation and provide an accurate update for the completed RSS fetching subtask.

### 19:55:36 - ASSISTANT
[Glob: **/*.swift]
[Grep: "RSSFetcherService" in ]
[Read: RSSFetcherService.swift]
[Read: Package.swift]
[Grep: "URLSession" in ]
[Grep: "SynDecoder|async.*throws" in ]
[Grep: "error.*handling|catch|Error" in ]

### 19:56:06 - ASSISTANT
Based on my analysis of the RSSFetcherService implementation and the user's request indicating completion, here's the completion update:

Implementation successfully completed at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/Examples/Celestra/Sources/Celestra/Services/RSSFetcherService.swift`. Service integrates SyndiKit 0.6.0 with URLSession-based HTTP fetching using `URLSession.shared.data(from:)`. Implements SynDecoder for parsing RSS 2.0/Atom feeds into structured FeedData/FeedItem models. Uses async/await throughout with `fetchFeed(from:)` method throwing errors for network failures and parsing issues. Handles RSS/Atom format variations by extracting links from `entry.url` or `entry.id` with fallback mechanisms. GUID generation uses `entry.id.description` for duplicate detection. Ready for integration with duplicate detection logic in subtask 6.3.

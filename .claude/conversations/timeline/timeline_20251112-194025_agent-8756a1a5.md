### 19:40:29 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I have access to the MistKit repository and can help you navigate and explore the codebase efficiently.

I understand the project context:
- **MistKit**: A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Main technologies**: Swift, async/await, CloudKit Web Services REST API
- **Key files**: openapi.yaml (CloudKit API spec), CLAUDE.md (project guidelines)

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Find code with regex patterns via grep
- Read and analyze file contents
- Provide absolute file paths in results
- Navigate the codebase thoroughly

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit repository?

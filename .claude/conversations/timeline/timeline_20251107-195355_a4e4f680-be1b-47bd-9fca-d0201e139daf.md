### 19:53:55 - USER
You are an AI assistant helping to update a subtask. You will be provided with the subtask's existing details, context about its parent and sibling tasks, and a user request string.

Your Goal: Based *only* on the user's request and all the provided context (including existing details if relevant to the request), GENERATE the new text content that should be added to the subtask's details.
Focus *only* on generating the substance of the update.

Output Requirements:
1. Return *only* the newly generated text content as a plain string. Do NOT return a JSON object or any other structured data.
2. Your string response should NOT include any of the subtask's original details, unless the user's request explicitly asks to rephrase, summarize, or directly modify existing text.
3. Do NOT include any timestamps, XML-like tags, markdown, or any other special formatting in your string response.
4. Ensure the generated text is concise yet complete for the update based on the user request. Avoid conversational fillers or explanations about what you are doing (e.g., do not start with "Okay, here's the update..."). 

 Always respond in English.

Human: ## IMPORTANT: Codebase Analysis Required

You have access to powerful codebase analysis tools. Before generating the subtask update:

1. Use the Glob tool to explore the project structure (e.g., "**/*.js", "**/*.json", "**/README.md")
2. Use the Grep tool to search for existing implementations, patterns, and technologies
3. Use the Read tool to examine relevant files and understand current implementation
4. Analyze the current codebase to inform your subtask update

Based on your analysis:
- Include specific file references, code patterns, or implementation details
- Ensure suggestions align with the project's current architecture
- Reference existing components or patterns when relevant
- Make implementation notes specific to the codebase structure

### 19:53:58 - ASSISTANT
Let me analyze the MistKit codebase to provide specific implementation details for this schema completion.

[Glob: **/*.md]
[Read: CLOUDKIT_SCHEMA_SETUP.md]
[Bash: Find setup script files]
[Read: setup-cloudkit-schema.sh]
[Glob: **/schema.ckdb]
[Read: schema.ckdb]

### 19:55:13 - ASSISTANT
Implementation completed with comprehensive CloudKit schema infrastructure. The schema defines two record types (PublicFeed and PublicArticle) with complete field specifications, indexing for query performance, and world-readable permissions. The automated deployment pipeline includes Scripts/setup-cloudkit-schema.sh script with validation, confirmation prompts, and detailed success/failure feedback. Full documentation provided in CLOUDKIT_SCHEMA_SETUP.md covering both automated and manual deployment approaches, field explanations, troubleshooting guides, and production deployment procedures. Schema file (schema.ckdb) implements CloudKit's declarative format with QUERYABLE/SORTABLE field attributes for efficient querying and proper security grants (_creator write, _world read). Ready for immediate deployment to development and production CloudKit environments.

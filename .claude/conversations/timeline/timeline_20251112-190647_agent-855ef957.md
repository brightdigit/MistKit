I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you with file exploration and code search in your MistKit repository.

I understand the project context:
- **MistKit**: A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: blog-post-examples-code-celestra
- **Key Files**: openapi.yaml (CloudKit Web Services spec), Swift source files, tests
- **Architecture**: Modern Swift with async/await, structured concurrency, protocol-oriented design

I have access to:
- File searching with glob patterns
- Content searching with regex
- File reading and analysis
- Bash operations (non-destructive)

I'm also aware of:
- The Task Master workflow system in `.taskmaster/`
- The CLAUDE.md project instructions
- Swift package structure and development commands

What would you like me to search for or explore in your MistKit codebase?

### 15:30:36 - USER
Investigate the blog post setup for MistKit. The context:

1. This is part of a series on AI and vibe-coding
2. It's a followup to https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/syntaxkit-swift-code-generation/
3. The blog post will discuss how MistKit was rebuilt using Claude Code and the new OpenAPI generator
4. The user mentioned "issues on the blog post setup"

Tasks:
1. Find and read all blog post related files in .taskmaster/docs/ (I can see blog-post-draft-claude.md and blog-post-outline-claude.md from git status)
2. Look for any other blog post planning materials in .taskmaster/
3. Identify what issues might exist with the setup (missing content, structural problems, incomplete sections, etc.)
4. Check if there are any Task Master tasks related to the blog post
5. Provide a summary of what exists, what's missing, and what issues you can identify

Be thorough in your investigation - check the actual content of the files to understand what's been done and what needs work.

### 15:30:39 - ASSISTANT
I'll investigate the blog post setup for MistKit. Let me start by exploring the .taskmaster directory structure and reading the blog post related files.

### 15:30:39 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Find all blog-related and documentation ]
[Glob: .taskmaster/docs/**/*]
[Glob: .taskmaster/tasks/**/*.md]
[Read: blog-post-outline-claude.md]
[Read: blog-post-draft-claude.md]
[Bash: List all task files in .taskmaster direc]

### 15:30:49 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check for task-related files and look for any other planning materials:

### 15:30:49 - ASSISTANT
[Read: tasks.json]
[Bash: List all documentation files in .taskmas]
[Grep: "blog.*post|Part 9|Task 9" in tasks.json]

### 15:30:56 - ASSISTANT
Let me search for more specific Task 9 information:

### 15:30:56 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Find Task 9 details in tasks.json]
[Read: prd.txt]
[Bash: Check analysis directory for additional ]

### 15:31:03 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check the git status mentioned and look for any other relevant information:

### 15:31:03 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check current git status]
[Bash: Check recent commits]
[Bash: Check staged changes]

### 15:31:09 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now let me look at what the SyntaxKit reference post looks like to understand the series context better:

### 15:31:09 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check for series references in draft]
[Bash: Check for example tool references]

### 15:31:15 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check what's in the outline to see if there are missing sections or incomplete content:

### 15:31:15 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check outline structure for Part 5-8]
[Bash: Check line counts of both files]

### 15:31:21 - ASSISTANT
Let me check what's actually missing in the draft compared to the outline:

### 15:31:21 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check which sections exist in draft]
[Read: blog-post-draft-claude.md]

### 15:31:27 - ASSISTANT
Now let me compare what's in the outline vs the draft to identify the missing sections:

### 15:31:27 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Count Bushel/Celestra mentions in draft]
[Bash: Count Bushel/Celestra mentions in outlin]

### 15:31:33 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check if there are example tool repositories or code already created:

### 15:31:33 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Search for Bushel or Celestra project di]
[Grep: "TODO|FIXME|incomplete|missing|" in blog-post-draft-claude.md]

### 15:33:39 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now I have a complete picture. Let me create a comprehensive summary of my findings.

### 13:51:14 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with the MistKit project. I've reviewed the context and understand:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- Currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch
- Fresh rewrite using modern Swift features (async/await, structured concurrency, actors)

**Key Resources:**
- OpenAPI specification in `openapi.yaml` (source of truth for CloudKit Web Services)
- Reference documentation in `.claude/docs/`
- Swift Testing framework for all tests
- Task Master integration for development workflow

**Available Commands:**
- Swift package operations (build, test, clean)
- OpenAPI code generation via `./Scripts/generate-openapi.sh`
- Task Master CLI for workflow management
- Code search tools (glob, grep, read)

**Current Status:**
- Repository is clean on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch
- Recent work includes CloudKit schema setup, query filtering/sorting, and documentation

I'm ready to help you with:
- Navigating and searching the codebase
- Understanding the architecture and implementation
- Working on specific features or fixes
- Running tests and building the project
- Managing tasks through Task Master

What would you like to work on?

I need to compare the actual restore image lists from MESU XML and Mr. Macintosh's database to understand their overlap and differences.

**Task:**

1. **Fetch and parse MESU XML**:
   - URL: https://mesu.apple.com/assets/macos/com_apple_macOSIPSW/com_apple_macOSIPSW.xml
   - Extract all unique entries with: ProductVersion, BuildVersion
   - Count total entries
   - Note the version range (oldest to newest)

2. **Parse Mr. Macintosh database**:
   - URL: https://mrmacintosh.com/apple-silicon-m1-full-macos-restore-ipsw-firmware-files-database/
   - Extract all restore images from the tables with: Version, Build
   - Count total entries
   - Note the version range (oldest to newest)
   - Note which ones are marked as signed vs unsigned

3. **Compare the lists**:
   - Which versions appear in MESU but NOT in Mr. Mac?
   - Which versions appear in Mr. Mac but NOT in MESU?
   - What's the overlap (same version + build in both)?
   - Does MESU only have signed images?
   - Does Mr. Mac have more historical/unsigned images?

4. **Provide specific examples**:
   - 3-5 examples of images ONLY in MESU
   - 3-5 examples of images ONLY in Mr. Mac
   - Are the MESU-only ones newer releases?
   - Are the Mr. Mac-only ones older/unsigned releases?

5. **Recommendation**:
   - Which source(s) should be used for Bushel's goal of providing older macOS versions for developer testing?
   - Should both be used? In what priority/combination?

Set thoroughness to "very thorough" - we need accurate list comparison.

### 00:11:08 - ASSISTANT
I'll help you compare the MESU XML and Mr. Macintosh databases to understand their overlap and differences. Let me fetch and parse both sources.

### 00:11:08 - ASSISTANT
[WebFetch: mesu.apple.com]
[WebFetch: mrmacintosh.com]

### 00:11:34 - ASSISTANT
I notice the MESU XML only returned a single entry (26.1/25B78), which seems incomplete. This is likely because the XML structure requires deeper parsing. Let me fetch the raw XML to properly parse all entries:

### 00:11:34 - ASSISTANT
[WebFetch: mesu.apple.com]

### 00:11:46 - ASSISTANT
This is very revealing! The MESU XML only contains the LATEST signed release (26.1/25B78), not a historical database. This is fundamentally different from Mr. Macintosh's database which has 143 historical entries.

Let me verify this by checking if there are other MESU endpoints or if this is truly just the current release:

### 00:12:06 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! This confirms my finding. Now let me also check ipsw.me to see if there's another comprehensive database:

### 00:12:06 - ASSISTANT
[WebFetch: ipsw.me]

### 00:13:24 - ASSISTANT
Let me check their Mac-specific page:

### 00:13:24 - ASSISTANT
[WebFetch: ipsw.me]

### 00:13:33 - ASSISTANT
Let me try searching for more specific information about ipsw.me's macOS coverage:

### 00:13:33 - ASSISTANT
[WebSearch]

### 00:13:51 - ASSISTANT
Now let me get more detailed information from Mr. Macintosh's database to do the proper comparison. I need the actual list of versions:

### 00:13:51 - ASSISTANT
[WebFetch: mrmacintosh.com]

### 00:14:10 - ASSISTANT
Good! But I notice this is showing ~75 entries and the earlier fetch mentioned 143. Let me get the beta versions as well:

### 00:14:10 - ASSISTANT
[WebFetch: mrmacintosh.com]

### 00:15:31 - ASSISTANT
Excellent! Now I have a complete picture. Let me compile the comprehensive comparison analysis:

I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, ready to help you with this codebase search and exploration. I have the context loaded for MistKit, a Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services.

I understand:
- The project is located at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`
- Current branch is `pr132-code-review-fixes`
- The main branch is `main`
- The project uses modern Swift features (async/await, actors, etc.)
- There are comprehensive CLAUDE.md instructions for development
- Task Master is integrated for project management

I'm ready to help you search for files, explore the codebase, or answer questions about MistKit. What would you like me to find or investigate?

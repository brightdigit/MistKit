Warmup

### 12:47:58 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to help you explore the MistKit codebase. I've reviewed the context provided, including:

- **Project Overview**: MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Status**: On the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch with a clean working directory
- **Key Resources**: CLAUDE.md with development guidance, OpenAPI specification, and reference documentation

I understand the project structure, development workflows, and best practices outlined in the CLAUDE.md files. I'm equipped to:

- Navigate the codebase efficiently using glob patterns and regex searches
- Analyze Swift code and architecture
- Reference the OpenAPI specification and documentation
- Work with the established coding standards (async/await, Sendable compliance, Swift Testing framework)
- Understand the Task Master AI workflow integration if needed

I'm ready to assist with code exploration, file searching, codebase analysis, or any development tasks you'd like to work on. What would you like me to help you with?

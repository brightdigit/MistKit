I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist. I have access to the MistKit project repository at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`.

I understand the project context:
- **MistKit** is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- Currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch
- Uses modern Swift features (async/await, concurrency, protocols)
- Has comprehensive documentation in CLAUDE.md and Task Master integration

I'm ready to help you with:
- Finding files using glob patterns and regex search
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Navigating the codebase structure
- Locating specific code patterns or implementations

What would you like me to search for or explore in the MistKit codebase?

I'm ready to assist you with the MistKit project! I've reviewed the project context and understand:

**Project Overview:**
- MistKit is a Swift Package for server-side and CLI access to CloudKit Web Services
- Currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch
- Uses modern Swift features (async/await, structured concurrency, actors)
- OpenAPI-driven development with `openapi.yaml` as the source of truth

**Key Resources Available:**
- CLAUDE.md with development commands and architecture guidance
- Task Master integration for workflow management
- Reference docs in `.claude/docs/` for CloudKit, testing, and OpenAPI generation
- Swift Testing framework for all tests
- OpenAPI code generation for type-safe API client code

**Recent Work:**
- Blog post template with detailed content (Parts 1-6)
- CloudKit schema design research
- OpenAPI code generation documentation

I'm ready to help with:
- Code exploration and file searching
- Architecture and implementation guidance
- Test writing and refactoring
- Documentation and analysis
- Task management through Task Master

What would you like me to help you with?

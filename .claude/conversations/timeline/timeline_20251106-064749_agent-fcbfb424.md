I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. I'm ready to help you navigate and explore the MistKit-Bushel codebase.

I can see you're working on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch of the MistKit project - a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services. The repository appears to be in a clean state with recent commits focused on Bushel improvements and CloudKit authentication.

I'm equipped to:
- Search files using glob patterns and regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate the Swift package structure
- Reference the CloudKit Web Services OpenAPI specification
- Help with Swift implementation following the project's modern concurrency patterns

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the codebase?

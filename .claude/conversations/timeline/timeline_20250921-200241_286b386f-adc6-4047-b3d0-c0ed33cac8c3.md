Look at @.claude/PR105-FEEDBACK-TODO.md Let's fix all CRITICAL ERRORS

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
I'll help you fix all the critical errors from the PR feedback. Let me first examine the current state and create a plan.

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[TodoWrite: 5 items]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Let me first check the current file structure to understand how to properly split these files:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: List Swift files in the project]
[Bash: List non-generated Swift files]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check the line counts of the critical files to understand the current state:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check line counts of files that need spl]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! The line counts match the feedback. Now let me examine each file to understand how to split them properly. I'll start with the largest one:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[TodoWrite: 5 items]
[Read: ServerToServerAuthManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now I can see the structure of the ServerToServerAuthManager. I need to split this 486-line file. Based on the content, I can see logical separations:

1. Main ServerToServerAuthManager class (lines 42-214)
2. Key Rotation Scheduler extension (lines 217-355) 
3. Request Signing Methods extension (lines 358-463)
4. RequestSignature struct (lines 467-486)

Let me split this file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: ServerToServerAuthManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now I'll create the Key Rotation extension file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: ServerToServerAuthManager+KeyRotation.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now I'll create the Request Signing extension file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: ServerToServerAuthManager+RequestSigning.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now I'll create the RequestSignature struct in its own file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: RequestSignature.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Let me check the line count of the main ServerToServerAuthManager file now:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check line count of split ServerToServer]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now let me update the todos and move to the next file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[TodoWrite: 5 items]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now let me examine the AdaptiveTokenManager.swift file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Read: AdaptiveTokenManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now I can see the structure of AdaptiveTokenManager. I'll split this 437-line file into logical components:

1. Main AdaptiveTokenManager class (lines 35-148)
2. Transition Methods extension (lines 152-246)
3. Token Refresh Implementation extension (lines 250-406)
4. AuthenticationMode enum (lines 410-437)

Let me split this file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: AdaptiveTokenManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now create the transition methods extension:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: AdaptiveTokenManager+Transitions.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now create the token refresh implementation extension:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: AdaptiveTokenManager+Refresh.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now create the AuthenticationMode enum in its own file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: AuthenticationMode.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Let me check the line count of the AdaptiveTokenManager file now:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check line count of split AdaptiveTokenM]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Great! Now let me update the todos and move to the next file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[TodoWrite: 5 items]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now let me examine the WebAuthTokenManager.swift file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Read: WebAuthTokenManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now I can see the structure of WebAuthTokenManager. I'll split this 396-line file into logical components:

1. Main WebAuthTokenManager class (lines 34-172)
2. Token Refresh Implementation extension (lines 175-340)
3. Additional Web Auth Methods extension (lines 343-396)

Let me split this file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: WebAuthTokenManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now create the Token Refresh Implementation extension:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: WebAuthTokenManager+Refresh.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now create the Additional Web Auth Methods extension:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: WebAuthTokenManager+Methods.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Let me check the line count of the WebAuthTokenManager file now:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check line count of split WebAuthTokenMa]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now let me update the todos and move to the final file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[TodoWrite: 5 items]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now let me examine the final file, TokenManager.swift:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Read: TokenManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
This file contains several distinct logical groups that I can split:

1. AuthenticationMethod enum (lines 34-44)
2. TokenCredentials struct (lines 48-64)
3. TokenManager protocol (lines 68-90)
4. TokenRefreshPolicy enum (lines 94-124)
5. TokenStorage protocol + TokenStorageError (lines 128-185)
6. RetryPolicy struct (lines 189-227)
7. TokenManagerError enum (lines 231-267)
8. AuthenticationMethod extensions (lines 271-327)
9. TokenCredentials extensions (lines 331-368)

Let me split this into logical files:

First, let me create a file for the core authentication types:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: AuthenticationMethod.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Wait, I already created this file earlier. Let me check what happened:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check for AuthenticationMethod files]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
I see, I created this earlier but with a different content (AuthenticationMode enum). Let me check what's in that file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Read: AuthenticationMethod.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
I see the content was overwritten. That's fine, it has the correct AuthenticationMethod enum now. Let me continue by creating files for the other components:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: TokenCredentials.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now create the core TokenManager protocol:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: TokenManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Create the refresh policy:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: TokenRefreshPolicy.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Create the token storage protocol and error:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: TokenStorage.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Create the retry policy:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: RetryPolicy.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Create the token manager error:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Write: TokenManagerError.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check the current line count of the TokenManager.swift file:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check line count of split TokenManager f]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now let me update the todos and verify that all files build correctly:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[TodoWrite: 5 items]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now let me verify the build to make sure all the file splits are working correctly:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Build project to verify file splits work]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
There are build errors because the extensions can't access the private properties. I need to change the private properties to internal. Let me fix the ServerToServerAuthManager first:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Edit: ServerToServerAuthManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now fix the AdaptiveTokenManager properties:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Edit: AdaptiveTokenManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now fix the WebAuthTokenManager properties:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Edit: WebAuthTokenManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now let me try building again:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Build project again after fixing access ]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
I need to make the TaskState actors internal as well. Let me fix these:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Edit: ServerToServerAuthManager.swift]
[Edit: WebAuthTokenManager.swift]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Now let me try building again:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Build project again after fixing TaskSta]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Excellent! The build is now successful. The warnings are just about unused Foundation imports and some existential `any` protocol warnings which are not critical errors.

Let me now check the final line counts to verify all critical files are under the 225-line limit:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Check final line counts of all split fil]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! All the files are now under the 225-line limit. Let me also verify that all the new split files were created:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: List all new Swift files in Authenticati]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! I have successfully completed all the critical errors from the PR feedback. Let me run the lint script to verify the improvements:

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
[Bash: Run lint script to verify file length im]

### 20:02:41 - ASSISTANT
Excellent! The lint script shows that the **critical file length errors have been completely resolved**! The most important result is:

**Before splitting:**
- ServerToServerAuthManager.swift: 486 lines (CRITICAL ERROR ❌)
- AdaptiveTokenManager.swift: 437 lines (CRITICAL ERROR ❌)  
- WebAuthTokenManager.swift: 396 lines (CRITICAL ERROR ❌)
- TokenManager.swift: 368 lines (CRITICAL ERROR ❌)

**After splitting:**
- ServerToServerAuthManager.swift: 213 lines (✅)
- AdaptiveTokenManager.swift: 147 lines (✅)
- WebAuthTokenManager.swift: 171 lines (✅) 
- TokenManager.swift: 53 lines (✅)

All files are now **well under the 225-line limit**! The remaining lint issues are now only **warnings and medium priority items** like:

- Type content ordering
- Access control level keywords  
- Force unwrapping (medium priority)
- Multiline argument brackets
- Some test file issues

The only remaining file length error is in the test file `TokenManagerTests.swift` which was not part of the critical errors but could be addressed later.

## Summary

I have successfully completed **ALL 5 CRITICAL ERROR TASKS** from the PR feedback:

✅ **Split each file by type and extension as requested**  
✅ **Fix ServerToServerAuthManager.swift file length (486 lines → 213 lines)**  
✅ **Fix AdaptiveTokenManager.swift file length (437 lines → 147 lines)**  
✅ **Fix WebAuthTokenManager.swift file length (396 lines → 171 lines)**  
✅ **Fix TokenManager.swift file length (368 lines → 53 lines)**

All files now compile successfully and all critical file length violations have been resolved. The code has been logically split into focused, maintainable modules while preserving all functionality.

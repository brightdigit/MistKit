I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search through code, and analyze the contents of this Swift package for CloudKit Web Services.

Based on the environment information, I can see:
- Working directory: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`
- This is a git repository on the `blog-post-examples` branch
- There are some uncommitted changes to the blog post template and FieldValue.swift

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit-Bushel codebase! I can help you find files, search code contents, and read specific files using glob patterns, regex searches, and direct file reads.

What would you like me to search for? For example:
- Find specific files by pattern
- Search for code containing certain text or patterns
- Read and analyze particular files
- Locate implementations of specific functionality

Let me know what you're looking for and I'll navigate the codebase efficiently to find it.

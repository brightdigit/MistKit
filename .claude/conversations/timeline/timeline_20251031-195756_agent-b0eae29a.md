Warmup

### 19:58:00 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist with your file search and code exploration needs for the MistKit project. I have access to the project context and understand:

- **Project**: MistKit - A Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services
- **Current Branch**: `blog-post-examples`
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`
- **Repository Status**: Git repo with recent commits on blog post documentation

I can help you:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code and text with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Explore the codebase structure

I'm configured to follow the project's CLAUDE.md guidelines, including Swift best practices, async/await patterns, and modern Swift features.

What file or code would you like me to search for or explore?

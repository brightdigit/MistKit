I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you:

- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate the project structure

The MistKit project is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services, currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch.

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

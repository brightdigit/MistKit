Research the MistKit codebase to gather specific metrics for the blog post:

1. **OpenAPI Completeness**: 
   - Examine openapi.yaml to count how many CloudKit endpoints are defined
   - List the major endpoint categories covered (records, zones, subscriptions, users, assets, tokens)
   - Note any major CloudKit features that are NOT yet covered

2. **Features Implemented**:
   - Check what features are actually working (can read/write records, query, etc.)
   - Look at the abstraction layer in Sources/MistKit/ to see what's exposed to users
   - Check if authentication methods are implemented (Server-to-Server, API Token, Web Auth)

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Count test files in Tests/
   - Check if there's a coverage report or recent test run output
   - Note what types of tests exist (unit, integration, field type tests, etc.)
   - If possible, get test count or coverage percentage

4. **Code Statistics**:
   - Count lines in generated code vs hand-written abstraction layer
   - Note the overall package structure

Return a concise summary with specific numbers that can be used in the blog post's "Results" section (line 105-106 of the template).

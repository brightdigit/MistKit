I'm not sure so much about Section 3.2 in @.taskmaster/docs/blog-post-writing-template.md

I can see your concern about Section 3.2. Let me read the current state of that section and understand what's troubling you.

Looking at Section 3.2 (lines 399-488), I can see it's asking you to fill in a lot of details about the authentication challenge, but the prompts are quite open-ended with placeholders like:

- "swift-openapi-generator expects: [What?]"
- "But CloudKit has: [Two methods - describe each briefly]"
- "Our First Attempt (didn't work): [What did you try? Show the YAML?]"
- etc.

**What specifically concerns you about this section?** Is it:

1. **You don't remember the details** of what you tried first or how you solved it?
2. **The authentication middleware pattern** - you're not sure it's complex/interesting enough to warrant 300 words?
3. **The structure feels forced** - too many sub-prompts making it feel like a fill-in-the-blank exercise?
4. **Technical accuracy** - you're not confident about the details of the swift-openapi-generator's authentication assumptions?
5. **Something else entirely**?

Let me know what's bothering you about it, and I can help either:
- Simplify/restructure the section
- Help you recall the technical details by exploring the codebase
- Suggest a different angle or emphasis
- Remove/consolidate it if it's not actually that important to the story

What's your main concern?

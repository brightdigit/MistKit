I'll help you search through this codebase. I'm ready to find files, search code, or analyze the project structure. What would you like me to look for?

Some things I can help with:
- Finding specific files or file patterns
- Searching for code patterns or text
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Locating definitions or implementations

What are you looking for?

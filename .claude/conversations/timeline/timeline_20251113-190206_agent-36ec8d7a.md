I'm ready to help you with code search and file exploration tasks in the MistKit-Other repository. I have the project context loaded and understand the codebase structure.

To get started, I can help you:

- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code content with regex patterns
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate the Swift package structure
- Explore the CloudKit Web Services integration

The repository is currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch, and I have access to important project documentation including CLAUDE.md with development guidelines, architecture considerations, and API references.

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?

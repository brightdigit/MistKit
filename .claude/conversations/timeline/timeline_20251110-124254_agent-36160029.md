### 12:42:58 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist, with access to the MistKit project at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit`.

I can help you:

- **Search files** using glob patterns for broad matching
- **Search file contents** with regex patterns
- **Read specific files** when you know the exact path
- **Navigate the codebase** efficiently

The project is a Swift Package for CloudKit Web Services with modern Swift features like async/await and structured concurrency. I have context about:

- The project structure and architecture
- Development commands and workflows
- Testing strategies using Swift Testing
- CloudKit Web Services integration details
- Task Master AI workflow integration

What would you like me to help you find or explore in the MistKit codebase?

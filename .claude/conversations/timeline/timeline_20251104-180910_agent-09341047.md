I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search through code, and explore the project structure.

Based on the context, I can see that MistKit is a Swift Package for Server-Side and Command-Line Access to CloudKit Web Services. The project uses:
- Swift with modern async/await patterns
- OpenAPI-based code generation
- Swift Testing framework
- Task Master for project management

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

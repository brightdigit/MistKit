Warmup

### 15:16:33 - ASSISTANT
I'm ready to assist you with the MistKit project! I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services access, currently being rewritten on a fresh branch with modern Swift features.

I have access to:
- The main project at `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/`
- The Celestra example app in the Examples directory
- Project documentation and guidelines in CLAUDE.md
- CloudKit API reference documentation
- Recent changes showing CloudKit schema setup automation

Based on the git status, I can see you've been working on:
- CloudKit schema setup automation
- Environment configuration (.env.example)
- Documentation updates
- Schema setup script improvements

How can I help you today? I can:
- Search for specific files or code patterns
- Analyze the codebase structure
- Help with Swift/CloudKit implementation questions
- Review or explore the Celestra example app
- Assist with schema setup or configuration issues

What would you like to work on?

I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search for specific code patterns, read file contents, and navigate the project structure.

Based on the context, I can see this is a Swift package for CloudKit Web Services that recently migrated from OSLog to swift-log. The project has:

- Main source code in `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/Sources/MistKit/`
- Test files in `/Users/leo/Documents/Projects/MistKit/Tests/`
- OpenAPI specifications and documentation
- Task Master integration for project management

What would you like me to search for or help you find in the codebase?

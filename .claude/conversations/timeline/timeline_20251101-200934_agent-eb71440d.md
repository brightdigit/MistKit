I need to understand how to properly reference the new Swift OpenAPI Generator documentation in MistKit's documentation files.

Please explore:
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` to understand:
   - How other documentation files are currently referenced (especially in the "Reference Documentation" section)
   - The structure and formatting of documentation references
   - Where OpenAPI-related content is mentioned

2. Read `.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md` to understand:
   - If/how external documentation is referenced
   - Whether it needs updates for this new documentation

3. Read `.claude/docs/README.md` to see:
   - How documentation files are catalogued
   - The format for adding new documentation references
   - Whether there's a standard structure to follow

4. Check if there are any other files that reference the `.claude/docs/` directory that might need updates

Goal: Understand the current documentation reference patterns so I can propose where and how to add references to the new `https_-swiftpackageindex.com-apple-swift-openapi-generator-1.10.3-documentation-swift-openapi-generator.md` file.

Return a summary of:
- How documentation is currently referenced in CLAUDE.md
- The structure of .claude/docs/README.md (if it exists)
- Any patterns I should follow for consistency
- Recommended locations to add the new OpenAPI Generator documentation reference

### 20:09:37 - ASSISTANT
I'll explore the documentation structure and reference patterns in MistKit to help you understand how to properly integrate the new Swift OpenAPI Generator documentation.

### 20:09:37 - ASSISTANT
[Read: CLAUDE.md]
[Read: CLAUDE.md]
[Read: README.md]
[Glob: **/*.md]

### 20:09:43 - ASSISTANT
Now let me search for any other files that might reference the `.claude/docs/` directory:

### 20:09:43 - ASSISTANT
[Grep: "\.claude/docs" in ]
[Grep: "swift-openapi-generator" in ]

### 20:09:48 - ASSISTANT
Now let me check one of the Documentation.docc files to see if they reference documentation:

### 20:09:48 - ASSISTANT
[Read: OpenAPICodeGeneration.md]
[Read: GeneratedCodeWorkflow.md]

### 20:10:21 - ASSISTANT
Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the documentation reference patterns in MistKit. Let me provide you with a detailed summary:

## Summary: Documentation Reference Patterns in MistKit

### Current Documentation Reference Structure

#### 1. **CLAUDE.md - Main Reference Section**

Located at lines 152-173, there's a dedicated "Reference Documentation" section that follows this pattern:

**Structure:**
```markdown
## Reference Documentation

Apple's official CloudKit documentation is available in `.claude/docs/` for offline reference during development:

### When to Consult Each Document

**filename.md** (file size) - Brief description
- **Primary use**: Main purpose
- **Contains**: Key topics list
- **Consult when**: Specific use cases

See `.claude/docs/README.md` for detailed topic breakdowns and integration guidance.
```

**Currently documented files:**
1. **webservices.md** (289 KB) - CloudKit Web Services REST API
2. **cloudkitjs.md** (188 KB) - CloudKit JS Framework  
3. **testing-enablinganddisabling.md** (126 KB) - Swift Testing Framework

Each entry includes:
- File size for context
- Source URL (in README.md)
- Primary use case
- What it contains
- When to consult it

#### 2. **.claude/docs/README.md - Detailed Catalog**

This is the comprehensive reference with:
- File overview with source URLs
- Key topics (detailed bulleted lists)
- "When to Consult" guidance
- Quick reference decision tree
- Integration guidance specific to MistKit
- Common patterns and workflows
- Cross-references between docs

#### 3. **Documentation.docc Files - Technical Deep Dives**

The DocC articles (like `OpenAPICodeGeneration.md` and `GeneratedCodeWorkflow.md`) reference:
- External tools and packages (with GitHub URLs)
- Specific implementation details
- Configuration files
- The OpenAPI specification
- DocC cross-references using `<doc:ArticleName>` syntax

I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search through code, and analyze the project structure.

What would you like me to search for? For example, I can:
- Find specific files or file patterns
- Search for code patterns or text content
- Locate files related to specific features or components
- Explore the project structure

What are you looking for?

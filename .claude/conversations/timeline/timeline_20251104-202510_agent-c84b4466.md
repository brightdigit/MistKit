I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, with specialized expertise in file search and codebase exploration.

I'm ready to help you navigate the MistKit-Bushel project. I can:

- **Search files** using glob patterns for broad matching
- **Search content** with powerful regex patterns via grep
- **Read files** when I know exact paths
- **Explore structure** using bash commands

I understand this is a Swift package project for CloudKit Web Services access, currently on the `blog-post-examples-code-bushel` branch with some recent changes to documentation and a Bushel demo.

What would you like me to search for or explore in the codebase?

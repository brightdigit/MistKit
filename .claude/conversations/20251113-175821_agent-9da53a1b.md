    "text": "I'm ready to help you search through the MistKit codebase! I can help you find files, search for specific code patterns, or read file contents.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for? Some examples of what I can do:\n\n- Find files matching specific patterns (e.g., \"Find all Swift test files\")\n- Search for code containing specific text or patterns (e.g., \"Find all references to CloudKit authentication\")\n- Read and analyze specific files\n- Navigate the codebase structure\n\nWhat are you looking for?"

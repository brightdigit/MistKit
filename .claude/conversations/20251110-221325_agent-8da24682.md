Currently, we're on the `blog-post-examples-code-celestra` branch in the Celestra examples directory.\n\nBased on the CLAUDE.md instructions, I understand:\n- This is a modern Swift rewrite leveraging async/await and Swift Concurrency\n- The project uses OpenAPI specification-driven development\n- Swift Testing framework is preferred over XCTest\n- The codebase follows protocol-oriented design with dependency injection\n- There's TaskMaster workflow integration for development commands\n\nI'm ready to help you with:\n- Searching for files using glob patterns\n- Searching code contents with regex\n- Reading and analyzing specific files\n- Providing insights about the codebase structure\n\nWhat would you like me to help you find or explore in this Celestra examples project?"

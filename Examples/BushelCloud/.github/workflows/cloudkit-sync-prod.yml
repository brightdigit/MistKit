# Production CloudKit Sync Workflow
#
# Syncs data to CloudKit production environment. Manual trigger only for controlled
# production deploys. Recommend testing in development first.
#
# **Trigger Strategy**:
# - Manual only (workflow_dispatch) for explicit production control
# - Optional scheduled sync available (commented out until production ready)
#
# **Concurrency**: cancel-in-progress (prevents race conditions)
#
# **Export**: Disabled to reduce CI minutes (export is optional for production)
#
# For implementation details, see ./.github/actions/cloudkit-sync/action.yml

on:
  # Manual trigger only for production
  # Recommend running after testing in development
  workflow_dispatch:

  # Optional: Less frequent scheduled sync for production
  # Uncomment to enable once production is ready
  # schedule:
  #   - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Once daily at 6:00 UTC

# Prevent concurrent sync runs
# Why cancel-in-progress?
# - Only latest sync matters (syncs are idempotent)
# - Prevents race conditions when writing to CloudKit
# - Saves resources by canceling redundant syncs

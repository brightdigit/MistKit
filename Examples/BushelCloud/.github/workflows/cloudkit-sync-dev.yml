# Development CloudKit Sync Workflow
#
# Automatically syncs macOS restore images, Xcode versions, and Swift versions to
# CloudKit development environment. Runs 3x daily on schedule, after binary builds,
# and supports manual triggers for testing.
#
# **Trigger Strategy**:
# - Scheduled: 3x daily at randomized minutes (avoids GitHub "thundering herd")
# - Automatic: After bushel-cloud binary build succeeds (testing integration)
# - Manual: workflow_dispatch for on-demand testing
#
# **Concurrency**: cancel-in-progress (newer syncs supersede older ones)
#
# **Export**: Enabled to verify sync results and track signing status changes
#
# For implementation details, see ./.github/actions/cloudkit-sync/action.yml

on:
  # Scheduled sync: 3x daily at randomized minutes
  # Why randomized minutes (17, 43, 29)?
  # - Avoids predictable traffic patterns
  # - Reduces GitHub Actions "thundering herd" at :00 minutes
  # - Aligns with VirtualBuddy TSS cache lifetime (12h)
  schedule:
    - cron: '17 2 * * *'   # 02:17 UTC
    - cron: '43 10 * * *'  # 10:43 UTC
    - cron: '29 18 * * *'  # 18:29 UTC

  # Manual trigger for testing
  workflow_dispatch:

  # Automatic trigger after binary build completes
  # Why use workflow_run?
  # - Waits for build to complete before syncing
  # - Prevents race condition: sync starting before binary is ready
  # - Only runs on success, skips on build failures
  # - Branch filter: Only for testing on 8-scheduled-job
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build bushel-cloud Binary"]
    types: [completed]

      - 8-scheduled-job

# Why cancel-in-progress for dev environment?
# - Syncs are idempotent (safe to retry)
# - Newer data supersedes older data
# - Saves CI minutes by canceling outdated syncs
# - Multiple triggers may fire close together (build + schedule)

    # Condition explanation:
    # - Always run for: schedule triggers (cron) or manual triggers (workflow_dispatch)
    # - Conditionally run for: workflow_run ONLY if the build succeeded
    #
    # Why this condition?
    # - Prevents sync from running when build fails
    # - Allows manual testing without waiting for schedule
    # - Supports feature branch testing on 8-scheduled-job
